## When implementing RAG, how to properly generate a search query from the user prompt? What could be the issue with this example? o2-sim material density scaling ALICE simulation documentation examples

Generating a **search query** from a user prompt is a crucial step in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and getting it wrong can result in poor or irrelevant retrieval. Let’s break down what makes query generation “proper,” then examine your example and what might be going wrong.

### ✅ Proper Query Generation in RAG

A good search query should be:

1. **Concise but specific** – Capture the core informational need.
2. **Context-aware** – Understand implicit references or domain-specific shorthand.
3. **Disambiguated** – Avoid vagueness or overloading with unrelated terms.
4. **Retrieval-optimized** – Tuned for the retriever, not necessarily human readability.

### 🔍 Your Example Prompt

> **o2-sim material density scaling ALICE simulation documentation examples**

Let’s dissect this:

* **"o2-sim"** – likely a reference to ALICE’s simulation framework (in CERN).
* **"material density scaling"** – seems to be the core topic (likely detector materials).
* **"ALICE simulation"** – context (important).
* **"documentation examples"** – type of resource requested.

---

### 🚫 Possible Issues with This Query

1. **Lack of structure or clarity**:

   * It reads like a keyword soup, not a coherent question or phrase.
   * Retrievers may treat this as a bag of words and miss the relationships.

2. **Mixed intent**:

   * Are you looking for *how material density scaling works*?
   * Or for *code examples* in O2 simulation?
   * Or where it's *documented*?

3. **Unnecessary duplication**:

   * "ALICE" and "simulation" are implied in "o2-sim".

4. **Too domain-specific without context**:

   * General-purpose retrievers (like BM25 or even embeddings) may not pick up on what “material density scaling” means without extra semantic structure.

### ✅ Better Alternatives

Here are some rewrites that make retrieval clearer:

#### 📘 If you want **documentation**:

> `How is material density scaling handled in o2-sim for ALICE simulations?`

#### 💻 If you want **code/examples**:

> `o2-sim material density scaling code example ALICE detector simulation`

#### 🔍 For a more general query:

> `material density scaling in o2-sim ALICE simulation framework`

### ⚙️ Techniques to Improve Query Generation

If you're automating this (as in a RAG pipeline), use:

1. **Prompted LLM-based query rewriting**:
   Example prompt to an LLM:

   > "Rewrite the following user question into a concise search query for retrieving relevant ALICE O2-sim documentation: '\[original prompt]'"

2. **Prompt classification → query templates**:
   Classify intent (e.g., docs, code, explanation), then apply a template:

   * Code intent → `"example of [concept] in [framework]"`
   * Docs intent → `"how does [framework] handle [concept]"`

3. **Named Entity / Concept Recognition**:
   Use tools like spaCy or SciSpacy to extract domain terms and reweight query tokens.
