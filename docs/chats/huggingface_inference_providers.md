## How do HuggingFace API inference providers work? What is the limit for free users?

Hugging Face's **Inference Providers** is a unified API layer that allows you to run ML models hosted by a variety of trusted third-party providers (e.g. Cohere, Together AI, Fal‑AI, Replicate, HF‑Inference, and more) using a consistent interface. You can choose to route requests via Hugging Face, or supply your own provider’s API key for direct calls ([Hugging Face][1]).

### 🚀 How it works

1. **Team of Providers**
   You can run models on multiple integrated providers. When you select `provider="auto"` (or use defaults), Hugging Face will pick the best available provider for your model based on your preferences and availability ([Hugging Face][2], [Hugging Face][1]).

2. **Routing Modes**

   * **Routed by HF (default):** You authenticate with your Hugging Face token, and Hugging Face handles billing to the provider—you don’t need separate provider credentials.
   * **Custom provider key:** You can plug in your own API key for a supported provider—billings and credits are applied via that provider directly (and Hugging Face doesn’t take credits or markup) ([GitHub][3]).

3. **Billing model**

   * Each inference call costs compute-time × rate of the underlying hardware (e.g. \$0.00012 per second for some GPU models) ([Hugging Face][4]).
   * **Free-tier credits apply only to routed usage through HF** and only for Hugging Face–integrated providers. If you use your own token from a provider, **no free credits apply** ([Hugging Face][5]).

### 💸 Free Tier Limits

| Account Type         | Monthly Included Credits                           | Can Continue Usage After Credits Exhausted? |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Free User**        | Less than **\$0.10** of inference credit per month | ❌ No – access stops once depleted           |
| **PRO / Enterprise** | **\$2.00** per user (shared by seat for orgs)      | ✅ Yes – pay‑as‑you‑go past free credits     |

Once credits run out:

* **Free accounts can't continue inference on HF-routed providers**.
* **PRO/Enterprise** accounts can continue using integrated providers, with usage billed based on provider compute rates ([Hugging Face][4], [Hugging Face][5], [GitHub][6]).

### 🔍 Community Feedback (Reddit Insights)

A number of users report that Hugging Face used to offer 1,000+ requests per day to free users, but those limits have since changed dramatically:

* **Free users** have seen their limits drop to just **\$0.10/month**, translating to only 5–10 requests depending on model cost ([Reddit][7], [Reddit][8]).
* **PRO users** used to claim \~20,000 requests/day capability, but that was replaced by the flat **\$2/month credit** system, making it "very restrictive" ([Reddit][9]).

As one Redditor said:

> “They reduced the Inference API limit from 1000 calls daily to \$0.10 monthly” ([discuss.huggingface.co][10], [Reddit][8])

---

### ✅ TL;DR

* **Inference Providers** give you access to multiple ML inference providers through one API.
* You can either **route via HF** (using HF token, eligible for free credits) or **use your own provider key** (billed directly, not credit‑eligible).
* **Free users:** get <\$0.10/month—service stops once credits are up.
* **PRO users:** get \$2/month credits, and can continue via pay‑as‑you‑go beyond that.

Would you like help checking how many inferences that \$0.10 or \$2.00 credit actually get you for a specific model (like FLUX, Mistral, etc.)? Or want guidance on working with your own provider key? Just let me know!
