## How do HuggingFace API inference providers work? What is the limit for free users? (Think hard before responding!)

Here’s the quick, accurate version.

**How Hugging Face “Inference Providers” work**

* It’s a single proxy API (and SDKs) that routes your request to a chosen provider (e.g., Groq, Fireworks, Replicate, Together) or lets HF auto-pick one. You authenticate once with a Hugging Face token, and you can also pin a specific provider or even use an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. ([Hugging Face][1])
* Billing can happen two ways: (1) **Routed by HF**—you pay the provider’s own rates via your HF account (no markup), or (2) **Custom provider key**—HF just forwards your call and the provider bills you directly. ([Hugging Face][2])
* Usage from Hub features (model page widgets, Playground, etc.) also goes through Inference Providers and counts against your credits. ([Hugging Face][3])

**Free-tier limit (as of Aug 22, 2025)**

* **Free HF accounts get \$0.10 in Inference Provider credits each month** when routing through HF. After that, free users can’t continue usage via routed billing; PRO users get **\$2.00/mo** in credits and can continue on pay-as-you-go. (Team/Enterprise: \$2.00 per seat.) Exact cost per call depends on the model, provider, and inference time. ([Hugging Face][2])
* If you use the legacy **HF Inference (serverless)** provider, free accounts are also **rate-limited to roughly a few hundred requests per hour** (not a hard public number). For higher limits you’d upgrade to PRO or use dedicated endpoints. ([Hugging Face][4])

If you want, tell me which task/model/provider you’re targeting and I’ll estimate how many calls that \$0.10 roughly buys (it varies widely by model and latency).
