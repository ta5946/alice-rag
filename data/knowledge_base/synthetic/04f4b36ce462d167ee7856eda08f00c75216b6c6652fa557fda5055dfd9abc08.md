**Question:** What does the script ensure by checking if the environment variables O2DPG_ROOT and O2_ROOT are set?

**Answer:** The script ensures that the environment variables O2DPG_ROOT and O2_ROOT are set, otherwise it prints an error message and exits. This is to make sure that O2DPG and O2 are properly loaded and available for the subsequent commands to use.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--skipModules ZDC` argument in the simulation command?

**Answer:** The `--skipModules ZDC` argument in the simulation command is used to exclude the ZDC (Zero Degree Calorimeter) module from the simulation workflow. This can be beneficial when the ZDC is not required for the specific simulation being performed, potentially speeding up the simulation process and reducing the computational resources needed.

**Question:** What specific Monte Carlo generator is used in the workflow, and how is it configured in the script?

**Answer:** The specific Monte Carlo generator used in the workflow is TGeant4. It is configured in the script using the `-e TGeant4` option in the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` command.
