**Question:** What specific changes are required for the interaction rate determination in the simulation workflow, and how will this impact the digitization process?

**Answer:** To determine the interaction rate in the simulation workflow, the system type must be utilized to define this rate during digitization. This change involves modifying the digitization process to dynamically adjust the interaction rate based on the collision system parameters. This will ensure that the simulation accurately reflects the expected interaction behavior for the specific collision type, potentially leading to more realistic and precise digitization outcomes.
