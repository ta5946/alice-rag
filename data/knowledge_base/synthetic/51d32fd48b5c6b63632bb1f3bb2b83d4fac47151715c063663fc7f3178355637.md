**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--field ccdb` option in the o2-sim command?

**Answer:** The `--field ccdb` option in the o2-sim command is used to enable the use of the CCDB (Common Control Database) service within the simulation. This allows the simulation to access and use calibration and configuration data stored in the CCDB, which is essential for realistic simulation of detector responses and physics processes.

**Question:** What specific configuration key value is used to set the number of worker processes for parallel simulation in the hybrid generator, and how many worker processes are specified in this example?

**Answer:** The specific configuration key value used to set the number of worker processes for parallel simulation in the hybrid generator is "GeneratorHybrid.num_workers". In this example, 8 worker processes are specified.
