**Question:** What is the purpose of the hybridcocktail.json file in the Hybrid_cocktail example?

**Answer:** The purpose of the hybridcocktail.json file in the Hybrid_cocktail example is to provide an example configuration for the hybrid generator using cocktails. This file demonstrates how cocktails can be grouped within the JSON format, allowing for the generation of events using the specified cocktails through the hybrid generator.

**Question:** How does the Hybrid Generator ensure that each generator is pulled exactly once during the event generation process when using cocktails?

**Answer:** The Hybrid Generator ensures that each generator is pulled exactly once during the event generation process by generating one event for each cocktail, and since each generator is part of a specific cocktail, it is selected exactly once per cocktail event.

**Question:** What specific steps must be followed to configure the cocktail settings for the Hybrid generator example, given the current limitations of the template script?

**Answer:** To configure the cocktail settings for the Hybrid generator example given the current limitations of the template script, you must use the `hybridcocktail.json` file. This JSON file allows you to define and group cocktails, which are then used by the Hybrid generator for event generation. Since the template script does not support cocktail configuration at the moment, manually editing this JSON file is the required step to set up the cocktails for your simulation.
