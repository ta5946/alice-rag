**Question:** How does the Hybrid Generator ensure that each generator is pulled exactly once during the event generation process when using cocktails?

**Answer:** The Hybrid Generator ensures that each generator is pulled exactly once during the event generation process by generating one event for each cocktail, and since each generator is part of a specific cocktail, it is selected exactly once per cocktail event.
