**Question:** What is the purpose of using the `only_primarykine.ini` configuration file in the given example?

**Answer:** The purpose of using the `only_primarykine.ini` configuration file in the given example is to switch off physics processes and apply tight geometry cuts, thereby ensuring that the Geant4 simulation does not perform any work, and the events are generated solely by Pythia8. This allows for the simulation to skip the transport and physics stages, focusing only on the originally generated event kinematics.

**Question:** What are the key configuration settings in "only_primarykine.ini" that allow the simulation to skip transport and physics processes?

**Answer:** The key configuration settings in "only_primarykine.ini" that allow the simulation to skip transport and physics processes are:

- Switching off physics by configuring the simulation to not perform any physics steps.
- Implementing very tight geometry cuts, which effectively prevent Geant from performing any work, thus skipping the transport process.

**Question:** What specific configuration settings in the "only_primarykine.ini" file are necessary to ensure that Geant4 does not perform any physics processes during the simulation, and how do these settings contribute to saving only the originally generated event?

**Answer:** The specific configuration settings in the "only_primarykine.ini" file necessary to ensure that Geant4 does not perform any physics processes during the simulation include:

- Setting very tight geometry cuts, effectively preventing Geant4 from interacting with the geometry and performing physics processes.
- Switching off physics in the configuration file, which directly instructs Geant4 to skip all physics steps and focus solely on the primary particles generated.

These settings contribute to saving only the originally generated event by ensuring that no modifications are made to the particle states or trajectories through subsequent physics processes. By disabling physics and applying stringent geometry constraints, the simulation remains at the primary particle level, preserving the initial conditions without any subsequent interactions or changes.
