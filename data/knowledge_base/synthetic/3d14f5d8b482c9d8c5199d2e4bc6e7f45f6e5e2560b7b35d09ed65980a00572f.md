**Question:** What are the key configuration settings in "only_primarykine.ini" that allow the simulation to skip transport and physics processes?

**Answer:** The key configuration settings in "only_primarykine.ini" that allow the simulation to skip transport and physics processes are:

- Switching off physics by configuring the simulation to not perform any physics steps.
- Implementing very tight geometry cuts, which effectively prevent Geant from performing any work, thus skipping the transport process.
