**Question:** What specific actions should be taken regarding subdirectories in a typical submodule, and what is the purpose of separating headers into the include and src directories?

**Answer:** For a typical submodule, some subdirectories can be voluntarily left out or added depending on the specific needs. Headers should be placed in the include directory if they form part of the interface, and in the src directory if they do not. This separation helps in maintaining a clear distinction between public and private code, enhancing modularity and ease of use for developers.

**Question:** Why are headers for a module named "MyModule" stored in the directory "MyModule/include/MyModule" instead of "MyModule/include"?

**Answer:** Headers for a module named "MyModule" are stored in the directory "MyModule/include/MyModule" instead of "MyModule/include" to adhere to the constraints of header installation and usage. Specifically, headers must be installed in a directory named after the module, and code using these headers must include `MyModule/xyz.h`, working both when the headers are installed and when they are internal. This placement ensures compatibility whether the headers are part of the AliceO2 installation or in a separate repository.

**Question:** What is the rationale behind AliceO2's decision to have a mixture of per-detector and per-function sub-modules in its directory structure?

**Answer:** AliceO2 adopted a mixture of per-detector and per-function sub-modules in its directory structure to achieve a balance between organization by detector-specific functionalities and organization by general functionality. This approach allows for maintaining a clear separation of concerns for each detector while also centralizing common algorithms and utilities that are used across multiple detectors. The per-detector organization helps in managing specific aspects related to individual detectors such as reconstruction, simulation, calibration, and quality control. Meanwhile, the per-function organization enables the sharing of global algorithms and common tools that are not specific to any single detector but are essential for the entire AliceO2 framework. This hybrid structure leverages the strengths of both approaches, promoting modularity and reusability without overwhelming the project with too many repositories.
