**Question:** What is the default value for the number of signal events if not specified?

**Answer:** The default value for the number of signal events, if not specified, is 1.

**Question:** What command-line arguments are used to configure the number of signal events and time frames in the simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The command-line arguments used to configure the number of signal events and time frames in the simulation workflow are:

- `-ns ${NSIGEVENTS}` for the number of signal events, set to 1 by default.
- `-tf ${NTIMEFRAMES}` for the number of time frames, set to 1 by default.

**Question:** What specific conditions and parameters are used for generating background events in this simulation script, and how do they differ from the signal events?

**Answer:** Background events are generated using Pythia8 with the inelastic process and the pp collision system, indicated by the -genBkg pythia8 -procBkg inel --embedding parameters. The number of background events is set by the NBKGEVENTS variable, which defaults to 1. The interaction rate for background events is specified as 500000 via the --interactionRate 500000 flag. 

In contrast, signal events are generated externally, as denoted by the -gen external parameter. The signal events' number is controlled by the NSIGEVENTS variable, also defaulting to 1. There are no specific interaction rate settings provided for signal events in this script. Additionally, ZDC module skipping is enabled for signal events through the --skipModules ZDC flag.
