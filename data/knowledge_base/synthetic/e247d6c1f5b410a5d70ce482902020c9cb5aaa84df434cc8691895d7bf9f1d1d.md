**Question:** What will happen if the environment variables JALIEN_TOKEN_CERT and JALIEN_TOKEN_KEY are not set?

**Answer:** If the environment variables JALIEN_TOKEN_CERT and JALIEN_TOKEN_KEY are not set, the script will first check if there are token certificate and key files in the temporary directory (TMPDIR or /tmp). If such files exist, they will be used. If no such files are found, the script will output the message "This needs a tokencert and tokenkey file in the tmp folder" and exit with a status code of 1.

---

**Question:** What happens if neither the environment variable JALIEN_TOKEN_CERT nor the certificate files in the temporary directory are set?

**Answer:** If neither the environment variable JALIEN_TOKEN_CERT nor the certificate files in the temporary directory are set, the script will output the message "This needs a tokencert and tokenkey file in the tmp folder" and exit with a status code of 1.

---

**Question:** What specific conditions cause the script to exit with an error, and what is the exact error message provided in such cases?

**Answer:** The script will exit with an error if the `TOKENCERT` variable is not set and no token certificate file is found in the temporary directory. The exact error message provided in such cases is: "This needs a tokencert and tokenkey file in the tmp folder".

**Question:** What action does the script take if it detects an unsupported hardware architecture?

**Answer:** The script exits with an error code of 1 and outputs "Invalid architecture ${ARCH} detected. Exiting".

---

**Question:** What are the steps taken in the injection block to ensure the script is executed inside an Apptainer container if it's not already running within one?

**Answer:** The injection block first checks if the script is running inside an Apptainer (or Singularity) container by verifying the presence of the environment variables APPTAINER_NAME or SINGULARITY_NAME. If these variables are not set, indicating the script is not inside a container, the following steps are taken to ensure the script runs inside a container:

1. A temporary directory is created at /tmp/foo-${ALIEN_PID} if it does not already exist.
2. The temporary directory is populated with a token certificate, copied from /tmp/token*pem.
3. The original script is copied into this temporary directory.
4. The script detects the hardware architecture using the uname -i command. If the architecture is either aarch64 or x86_64, a flag ISAARCH64 is set to 1. If the architecture is invalid, the script exits with an error message.

---

**Question:** What specific actions does the script take if the detected architecture is not ARM or X86?

**Answer:** The script takes the following actions if the detected architecture is not ARM or X86: it outputs "Invalid architecture ${ARCH} detected. Exiting" to the console and subsequently exits with a status code of 1.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` commands in the document?

**Answer:** The `sed` commands in the document are used to remove certain sandboxing structures from the script. Specifically, they delete the following lines:

- A line that echoes the creation of a sandbox.
- A line that removes a directory named `alien-job-$ALIEN_PID`.
- A line that creates a temporary directory inside `alien-job-$ALIEN_PID`.
- A line that changes the working directory to `alien-job-$ALIEN_PID`.

These commands effectively eliminate the sandboxing mechanism that was previously in place, ensuring that the script does not rely on or create a specific sandbox directory structure.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` commands in the document, and how do they modify the script?

**Answer:** The `sed` commands in the document are used to remove certain lines from the script and to replace the placeholder with the actual Alien Job Process ID. Specifically:

1. The first `sed` command removes the lines that mention creating a fresh sandbox at every job attempt, along with the commands to remove the previous sandbox and create a new one.

2. The second `sed` command removes the line that creates a new directory for the sandbox.

3. The third `sed` command removes the line that changes directory to the sandbox location.

4. The fourth `sed` command replaces the placeholder `#ALIEN_PID#` with the actual value of the `ALIEN_PID` environment variable throughout the script.

These modifications effectively strip out the sandboxing structure and replace the placeholder with the current job's process ID, ensuring that the script operates correctly in a non-sandboxed environment.

---

**Question:** What specific modifications are made to the script to remove the sandboxing structure and how are they implemented?

**Answer:** The sandboxing structure is removed by executing the following sed commands:

1. `sed -i "/echo \"Create a fresh sandbox at every attempt of running the job: alien-job-$ALIEN_PID\"/d" "$SCRIPT"`: This command deletes the line that contains the echo command for creating a fresh sandbox.

2. `sed -i "/rm -rf alien-job-$ALIEN_PID/d" "$SCRIPT"`: This command removes the line responsible for deleting the sandbox directory.

3. `sed -i "/mkdir -p alien-job-$ALIEN_PID\/tmp/d" "$SCRIPT"`: This command eliminates the line that creates the temporary directory within the sandbox.

4. `sed -i "/cd alien-job-$ALIEN_PID/d" "$SCRIPT"`: This command removes the line that changes the working directory to the sandbox.

These commands are applied to the script using in-place editing with the `-i` option, ensuring that the sandboxing structure is no longer part of the script's execution.
