**Question:** What are the default values for the `collType`, `eCM`, and `rapidity` arguments in the Upcgen configuration script?

**Answer:** The default value for `collType` is 'PbPb', for `eCM` it is 5360, and for `rapidity` it is 'cent'.

---

**Question:** What are the valid choices for the `--rapidity` argument and what does each choice represent?

**Answer:** The valid choices for the `--rapidity` argument are 'cent_eta' and 'muon_eta'. 

- 'cent_eta' represents rapidity selection based on centralities.
- 'muon_eta' represents rapidity selection based on muon eta values.

**Question:** What specific condition must be met for the `process` argument to be set to 'kAxionLike' and how does this affect the configuration generation process?

**Answer:** For the `process` argument to be set to 'kAxionLike', it must be explicitly provided by the user when invoking the script, as 'kAxionLike' is listed as one of the choices for the `process` argument. When 'kAxionLike' is selected, it will enable the configuration generation process to include settings and parameters specific to the axion-like process. This affects the output configuration file, making sure that the generation of events for the axion-like process is properly configured according to the provided parameters and options.

**Question:** What is the value of `pZ` when the `collType` is 'PbPb'?

**Answer:** The value of `pZ` when the `collType` is 'PbPb' is 82.

---

**Question:** What are the values of `pZ` and `pA` assigned when 'OO' is present in `args.collType`, and how do these values differ from when 'PbPb' is present?

**Answer:** When 'OO' is present in `args.collType`, the values assigned are `pZ = 8` and `pA = 16`. These values differ from when 'PbPb' is present, where `pZ` is assigned 82 and `pA` is assigned 208.

---

**Question:** What is the value of `pA` when the `collType` is 'OO' and how is it determined in the code?

**Answer:** The value of `pA` when the `collType` is 'OO' is 16. This value is determined in the code through the conditional statement that checks if 'OO' is in `args.collType`. If this condition is true, then `pA` is assigned the value of 16.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `fout` object in the given script?

**Answer:** The `fout` object in the given script serves as a file handle for writing configuration parameters to an output file. Specifically, it is used to create and write to an output file specified by the `args.output` argument. The script uses `fout` to generate a configuration file with settings for the generator and trigger, based on the command-line arguments provided.

**Question:** What function is called in the trigger section when the argument `args.rapidity` is set to 'cent_rap'?

**Answer:** The function called in the trigger section when the argument `args.rapidity` is set to 'cent_rap' is `selectMotherPartInAcc(-0.9,0.9)`.

---

**Question:** What specific function is called in the trigger configuration when the `args.rapidity` is set to 'cent_eta', and what are the arguments passed to this function?

**Answer:** The specific function called in the trigger configuration when `args.rapidity` is set to 'cent_eta' is `selectDaughterPartInAcc`. No additional arguments are passed to this function in the given code snippet; the function is called with the arguments `-0.95,0.95` directly within the function name.
