**Question:** What are the valid choices for the `--rapidity` argument and what does each choice represent?

**Answer:** The valid choices for the `--rapidity` argument are 'cent_eta' and 'muon_eta'. 

- 'cent_eta' represents rapidity selection based on centralities.
- 'muon_eta' represents rapidity selection based on muon eta values.

**Question:** What are the values of `pZ` and `pA` assigned when 'OO' is present in `args.collType`, and how do these values differ from when 'PbPb' is present?

**Answer:** When 'OO' is present in `args.collType`, the values assigned are `pZ = 8` and `pA = 16`. These values differ from when 'PbPb' is present, where `pZ` is assigned 82 and `pA` is assigned 208.
