**Question:** What is the primary purpose of the Release Validation (RelVal) as described in the document, and how does it guide the validation process for the ALICE O2 simulation?

**Answer:** The primary purpose of the Release Validation (RelVal) is to ensure that new software releases of the ALICE O2 simulation meet the required standards and functionalities. It serves as a systematic process to validate the simulation tools and algorithms within the ALICE O2 framework. The RelVal documentation guides the validation process by providing a set of guidelines, test cases, and procedures to evaluate the performance and correctness of the software releases. This ensures that the simulation results are reliable and consistent across different releases, facilitating the collaboration and analysis among the ALICE O2 user community.
