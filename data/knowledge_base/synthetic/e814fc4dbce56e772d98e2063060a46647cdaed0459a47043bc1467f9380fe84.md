**Question:** What modifications would you make to the script to count events instead of tracks?

**Answer:** To modify the script to count events instead of tracks, the following changes should be made:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script counts the number of events, bc's and tracks in a list of AO2D.root files.
# run as: countevents.sh [file1] [file2] ...
# Remote file locations should be specified as: alien:///alice/.../AO2D.root

LIST=""
for var in "$@"
do
  LIST+="$var "
done

LIST=\"$LIST\"

root.exe -b -q -l countevents.C\("$LIST"\)
```

The key change is replacing `counttracks.C` with `countevents.C` in the `root.exe` command to specify the correct function for counting events.
