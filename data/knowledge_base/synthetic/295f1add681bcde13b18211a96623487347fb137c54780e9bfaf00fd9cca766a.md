**Question:** What command is used to copy configuration files from the STARlight root directory to the working directory?

**Answer:** The command used to copy configuration files from the STARlight root directory to the working directory is:

cp $STARLIGHT_ROOT/config/slight.in .
cp $STARLIGHT_ROOT/HepMC/*.awk .

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `starlight slight.in | tee slight.log` command in the script?

**Answer:** The `starlight slight.in | tee slight.log` command runs the STARlight simulation with the configuration file `slight.in`. The output of the STARlight simulation is both printed to the console and saved to `slight.log` through the `tee` command, allowing for both real-time viewing and logging of the simulation results.

**Question:** What specific STARlight configuration files are copied to the working directory and what is the purpose of the awk scripts used in the pipeline?

**Answer:** The specific STARlight configuration files `slight.in` and the `*.awk` files located in `$STARLIGHT_ROOT/HepMC` are copied to the working directory.

The awk scripts used in the pipeline serve the following purposes:

1. `pdgMass.awk` - This script processes the STARlight output, extracting particle masses from the Particle Data Group (PDG) database. It is likely used to map particle codes to their corresponding masses, which is essential for correctly interpreting the event data.

2. `starlight2hepmc.awk` - This script converts the output from STARlight into HepMC format. HepMC is a common format for particle physics event data, and this script facilitates the transformation of STARlight's output into a widely used and standard format for further analysis and simulation purposes.
