**Question:** What is the purpose of the `starlight slight.in | tee slight.log` command in the script?

**Answer:** The `starlight slight.in | tee slight.log` command runs the STARlight simulation with the configuration file `slight.in`. The output of the STARlight simulation is both printed to the console and saved to `slight.log` through the `tee` command, allowing for both real-time viewing and logging of the simulation results.
