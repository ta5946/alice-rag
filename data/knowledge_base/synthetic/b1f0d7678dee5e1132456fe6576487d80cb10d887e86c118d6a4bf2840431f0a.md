**Question:** What specific configuration settings in the `hybridconfig_parallel.json` file are crucial for setting up multiple clones of the same generator to enhance event generation speed?

**Answer:** The crucial configuration settings in the `hybridconfig_parallel.json` file for setting up multiple clones of the same generator to enhance event generation speed include:

- `numberOfGenerators`: This specifies the number of generator clones to be created for parallel event generation.
- `generatorName`: Identifies the generator type that will be cloned.
- `clonePrefix`: A prefix that will be added to each cloned generator's configuration to distinguish them.
- `eventGenerationConcurrency`: Sets the level of concurrency for event generation across the cloned generators.

These settings allow the Hybrid generator to efficiently distribute the event generation workload among multiple instances of the same generator, thereby speeding up the overall process.
