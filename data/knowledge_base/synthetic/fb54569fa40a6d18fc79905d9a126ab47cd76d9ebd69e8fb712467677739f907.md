**Question:** What is the formula used to calculate the embedding gain in the given script?

**Answer:** The formula used to calculate the embedding gain in the given script is:

SPEEDUP = (NTIMEFRAMES * BKGSIMTIME + SGNTIME + DIGITIME) / (BKGSIMTIME + SGNTIME + DIGITIME)

**Question:** What is the formula used to calculate the embedding gain in the given script?

**Answer:** The formula used to calculate the embedding gain in the given script is:

SPEEDUP = (NTIMEFRAME * BKGSIMTIME + SGNTIME + DIGITIME) / (BKGSIMTIME + SGNTIME + DIGITIME)

**Question:** What is the formula used to calculate the embedding gain, and how does it incorporate background simulation time, signal simulation time, digitization time, and the number of time frames?

**Answer:** The formula used to calculate the embedding gain is:

\[ \text{SPEEDUP} = \frac{\text{NTIMEFRAMES} \times \text{BKGSIMTIME} + \text{SGNTIME} + \text{DIGITIME}}{\text{BKGSIMTIME} + \text{SGNTIME} + \text{DIGITIME}} \]

Here, BKGSIMTIME represents the background simulation time, SGNTIME is the signal simulation time, DIGITIME denotes the digitization time, and NTIMEFRAMES is the number of time frames. The formula incorporates these elements by summing the product of the number of time frames and the background simulation time with the signal and digitization times in the numerator, and the sum of the individual times in the denominator.
