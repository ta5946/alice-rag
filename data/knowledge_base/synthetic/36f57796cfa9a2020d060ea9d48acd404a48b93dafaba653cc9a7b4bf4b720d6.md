**Question:** What is the effect of the `-mod "--skipModules ZDC"` option in the workflow configuration?

**Answer:** The `-mod "--skipModules ZDC"` option in the workflow configuration is used to exclude the ZDC (Zero-Degree Calorimeter) module from the simulation process. This means that the ZDC module will not be included when generating the events, thus potentially reducing the complexity or scope of the simulation to focus on other specific components or systems.

**Question:** What are the default values for the number of time frames, event rate, and system in this simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The default values for the number of time frames, event rate, and system in this simulation workflow are:
- Number of time frames: 1
- Event rate: 500,000
- System: pp ( proton-proton )
