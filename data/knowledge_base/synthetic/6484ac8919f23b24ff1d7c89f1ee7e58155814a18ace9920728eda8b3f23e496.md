**Question:** What is the purpose of the MCTrackToDPL example in the o2-sim documentation, and how does it facilitate the workflow for DPL tasks?

**Answer:** The MCTrackToDPL example in the o2-sim documentation serves to illustrate the process of using o2-sim as a real-time generator for DPL (analysis) tasks. It demonstrates how o2-sim can be integrated into the workflow to supply simulated events directly to DPL tasks, streamlining the transition from simulation to analysis.
