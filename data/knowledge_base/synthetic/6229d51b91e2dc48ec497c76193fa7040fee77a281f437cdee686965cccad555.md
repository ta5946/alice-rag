**Question:** What are the CCDB paths set for the "tuning", "digital", and "tuningbb" run types?

**Answer:** The CCDB paths set for the "tuning", "digital", and "tuningbb" run types are:

CCDBPATH1 is set to $DCSCCDBSERVER_PERS.

CCDBPATH2 is set to http://o2-ccdb.internal.

**Question:** What is the effect of the `RUNTYPE_ITS` variable being set to "digital" on the workflow?

**Answer:** When the `RUNTYPE_ITS` variable is set to "digital", an additional instance of the `o2-calibration-ccdb-populator-workflow` is added to the workflow with specific parameters. This instance uses `--ccdb-path="$CCDBPATH2"`, `--sspec-min 1`, and `--sspec-max 1`. This extra step is not included when `RUNTYPE_ITS` is not set to "digital".
