**Question:** What specific metadata objects are included in the scripts for MC productions, and how can they be utilized in subsequent analysis stages?

**Answer:** The scripts in this directory include metadata objects for collecting, defining, and uploading data related to Monte Carlo (MC) productions. These metadata objects are designed to be queried during subsequent analysis stages to facilitate further data processing. Specifically, the current version does not detail which exact metadata objects are included, but they are intended to provide necessary information for analysis. To enhance functionality, the TODO list suggests including additional details such as cycle number and software versions in the metadata objects. These additions would allow for more precise and detailed querying in analysis stages.
