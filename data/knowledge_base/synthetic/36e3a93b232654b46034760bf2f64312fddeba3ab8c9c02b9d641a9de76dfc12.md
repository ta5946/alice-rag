**Question:** What actions are taken if no analysis or AOD is specified when running the script?

**Answer:** If no analysis or AOD is specified when running the script, the following actions are taken:

- If no analysis is specified, the script outputs an error message: "ERROR: No analysis specified to be run" and exits with a status of 1.
- If no AOD is found, the script outputs an error message: "ERROR: No AOD found to be analysed" and exits with a status of 1.

**Question:** What is the purpose of setting the exit status using the variable `RC` in this script, and how does it affect the program flow?

**Answer:** The purpose of setting the exit status using the variable `RC` in this script is to capture the exit code of a command or series of commands executed previously, which in this case is implied by the absence of a specific command. This allows for the script to exit with a specific status that can be used by other processes or scripts that call this one. By assigning the exit code to `RC`, the script ensures that the exit status reflects the outcome of the last command or set of commands, enabling the script to gracefully handle success or failure scenarios.

The use of `RC` to store the exit status and then `exit ${RC}` to terminate the script with the same status affects the program flow by allowing the script to exit with a non-zero status if an error occurred, or with a zero status if the script completed successfully. This is a common practice in shell scripting to facilitate better error handling and communication of the script's outcome to the calling process.

**Question:** What will happen if the analysis ${testanalysis} is disabled and the environment variable include_disabled is not set?

**Answer:** A warning message will be printed indicating that the analysis ${testanalysis} is disabled, and the script will exit with status 0.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `NTF` variable in the script, and how is it determined?

**Answer:** The `NTF` variable in the script is used to determine the number of timeframes. It is calculated by finding all directories (folders) that match the pattern "tf*" using the `find` command, and then counting the number of matching directories with `wc | awk '//{print $1}'`.
