**Question:** What is the value of the `NTIMEFRAMES` variable and why might it be set to 1 for this simulation?

**Answer:** The value of the `NTIMEFRAMES` variable is 1. It is set to 1 for this simulation because the document states that "for pp and 50 events per TF, we launch only 4 workers." Here, "TF" likely refers to Time Frames, and setting `NTIMEFRAMES` to 1 simplifies the simulation by implying a single time frame is being processed.
