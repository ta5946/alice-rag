**Question:** What is the purpose of the `-j` parameter in the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` command and how does it affect the simulation process?

**Answer:** The `-j` parameter in the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` command is used to specify the number of workers or parallel jobs that will be utilized during the simulation process. This parameter directly influences how the simulation is executed, enabling the parallel processing of events, which can significantly speed up the simulation when running on multi-core systems or clusters. By setting the value of `-j` to a number greater than one, the simulation workflow is divided into multiple concurrent tasks, each processed by a separate worker. This parallelization helps in efficiently handling large datasets and complex scenarios, thereby reducing the overall time required for the simulation to complete.
