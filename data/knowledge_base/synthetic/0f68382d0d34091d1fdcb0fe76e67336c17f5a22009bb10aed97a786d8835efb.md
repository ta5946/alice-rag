**Question:** What is the default value of the `SHMSIZE` variable in the script?

**Answer:** The default value of the `SHMSIZE` variable in the script is `128 GB`.

**Question:** What is the default value of the `SHMSIZE` variable and what is its purpose in the context of the kr cluster finder?

**Answer:** The default value of the `SHMSIZE` variable is set to 128 GB. In the context of the kr cluster finder, this large shared memory size is allocated to facilitate efficient data handling and processing, likely for accommodating the substantial amount of data that this component needs to manage during its operations.

**Question:** What is the value of the `SHMSIZE` variable and what does it represent in the context of the script?

**Answer:** The value of the `SHMSIZE` variable is `128 GB`. In the context of the script, it represents the size of the global SHMEM (Shared Memory) allocation for the kr cluster finder.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `WRITER_TYPE` variable in the given script?

**Answer:** The `WRITER_TYPE` variable is used to specify the type of writer in the workflow. If the environment variable `TPC_KRYPTON_NO_WRITEOUT` is set to "1", then `WRITER_TYPE` is set to `--writer-type none`, which indicates that no writeout should be performed. Otherwise, the default value for `WRITER_TYPE` is an empty string.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `WRITER_TYPE` variable in the script and how does it affect the workflow?

**Answer:** The `WRITER_TYPE` variable in the script is used to conditionally set the writer type for the workflow. If the environment variable `TPC_KRYPTON_NO_WRITEOUT` is set to "1", the `WRITER_TYPE` is assigned the value `--writer-type none`. This configuration effectively disables the writing output of the TPC krypton raw filter workflow step. The `add_W` function is used to add workflow steps, and in the case of the TPC krypton raw filter step, the `WRITER_TYPE` is appended to the command line arguments. If `WRITER_TYPE` is set to `--writer-type none`, the TPC krypton raw filter step will not produce any output files, which can be useful for performance optimization or testing purposes where output files are not needed.

**Question:** What is the effect of the `TPC_KRYPTON_NO_WRITEOUT` environment variable on the `o2-tpc-krypton-raw-filter` workflow component, and how is this conditionally applied in the script?

**Answer:** The `TPC_KRYPTON_NO_WRITEOUT` environment variable, when set to "1", enables a condition in the script that modifies the behavior of the `o2-tpc-krypton-raw-filter` workflow component. Specifically, if `TPC_KRYPTON_NO_WRITEOUT` is set to "1", the script appends `--writer-type none` to the command line arguments of `o2-tpc-krypton-raw-filter`. This effectively disables writeout functionality for this component. If `TPC_KRYPTON_NO_WRITEOUT` is not set to "1" or is unset, the `--writer-type none` argument is not added to the command line, and the default writeout behavior for `o2-tpc-krypton-raw-filter` is used.

**Question:** What does the script do if the `WORKFLOWMODE` variable is set to "print"?

**Answer:** If the `WORKFLOWMODE` variable is set to "print", the script will output the workflow command to the console without executing it. Specifically, it will print "Workflow command:" followed by the contents of the `WORKFLOW` variable, with each segment separated by a pipe character and space replaced by a newline.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed "s/| */|\n/g"` command in the script, and how does it affect the output when WORKFLOWMODE is set to "print"?

**Answer:** The `sed "s/| */|\n/g"` command in the script is used to transform the workflow string. Specifically, it replaces multiple spaces following a pipe symbol (|) with a newline character (\n). This transformation affects the output when WORKFLOWMODE is set to "print" by breaking down the multi-line workflow string into individual lines, making each step or component of the workflow more readable and easier to understand when printed.

---

**Question:** What specific conditions must be met for the `eval` command to be executed, and how does the script ensure that the workflow is printed in a readable format when `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "print"?

**Answer:** For the `eval` command to be executed, the `WORKFLOWMODE` variable must not be set to "print". Instead, it must be set to any other value. The script ensures that the workflow is printed in a readable format when `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "print" by using the `sed` command to replace `| *` with `|` followed by a newline character. This transformation spreads the workflow command across multiple lines, making it easier to read.
