**Question:** What is the purpose of the `mapShifts` associative array in the given script, and how might it be used in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation documentation?

**Answer:** The `mapShifts` associative array in the given script is likely used to store shift values or mappings, possibly between different simulation parameters or coordinate systems. In the context of the ALICE O2 simulation documentation, it could be employed to map shift values for various components or settings required for the simulation, such as position shifts, time shifts, or other relevant parameters. This array might be used to apply specific shifts or adjustments to simulation data or configurations, ensuring accurate modeling of the experimental setup or particle interactions.
