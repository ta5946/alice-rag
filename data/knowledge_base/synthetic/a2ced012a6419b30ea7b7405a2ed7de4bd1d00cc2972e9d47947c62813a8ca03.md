**Question:** How does the custom external generator in this example adapt its behavior based on the background event's characteristics, and what specific action is taken in response to the embedding status notification?

**Answer:** The custom external generator in this example adapts its behavior based on the characteristics of the background event by determining the number of Pythia8 events to be embedded. This decision is made through a formula that utilizes the number of primary particles present in the background event.

In response to the embedding status notification, the generator calculates the number of Pythia8 events to be embedded, thereby tailoring the signal event generation process to the specific background event being used.

**Question:** What are the two settings used in the macro file to specify the generator external configuration, and what are their respective purposes?

**Answer:** The two settings used in the macro file to specify the generator external configuration are `GeneratorExternal.fileName` and `GeneratorExternal.funcName`. 

`GeneratorExternal.fileName` is used to specify the macro file that contains the configuration details. 

`GeneratorExternal.funcName` is used to define the specific function within the macro file that retrieves and sets the configuration parameters.
