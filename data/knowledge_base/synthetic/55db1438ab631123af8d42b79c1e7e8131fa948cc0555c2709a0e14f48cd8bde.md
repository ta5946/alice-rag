**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--configKeyValues` parameter in the given simulation command, and what specific configuration is being set for the diamond detector?

**Answer:** The `--configKeyValues` parameter in the given simulation command is used to set specific configurations for various parts of the simulation. In this case, it is being used to configure the diamond detector. The specific configuration being set is:

- The position of the diamond detector along the z-axis (2nd index) is set to 0.1 units.
- The width of the diamond detector along the z-axis is set to 0.05 units.

**Question:** What is the purpose of using the `--embedIntoFile` option in the command for producing hard jets?

**Answer:** The purpose of using the `--embedIntoFile` option in the command for producing hard jets is to embed the signal events into the background events, allowing for the analysis of signal events within the context of a simulated background. This is useful for creating a more realistic event sample that mimics the conditions of actual data taking.
