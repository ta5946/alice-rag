**Question:** What is the purpose of the `organise_prs` function in the given Python script?

**Answer:** The `organise_prs` function in the given Python script is designed to sort the pull requests (PRs) from a provided repository based on their merge time, from oldest to most recent. It categorizes the PRs into four groups: merged PRs and their merge times, simply closed PRs and their last update times, and open PRs along with their last update times.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `organise_prs` function and how does it categorize the pull requests?

**Answer:** The `organise_prs` function is designed to categorize pull requests (PRs) from a GitHub repository into four distinct categories based on their status: merged, simply closed, and open. It then sorts the merged PRs by the time they were merged, from the oldest to the most recent. Here's a breakdown of how it categorizes the pull requests:

1. **Merged PRs**:
   - These are collected in the `prs_merged` list.
   - The corresponding merge times are collected in the `merged_at` list.

2. **Closed PRs**:
   - These are categorized as either simply closed or open.
   - Simply closed PRs are collected in the `prs_closed` list.
   - The times when these PRs were closed are collected in the `closed_updated_at` list.
   - Open PRs that are closed but not yet merged are collected in the `prs_open` list.
   - The times when these open PRs were last updated are collected in the `open_updated_at` list.

By organizing the PRs in this manner, the function facilitates easier tracking and prioritization of which pull requests should be ported or further reviewed, particularly by sorting the merged PRs chronologically.

---

**Question:** What is the specific algorithm used to sort the merged PRs by their merge time, and how is it implemented in the `organise_prs` function?

**Answer:** The specific algorithm used to sort the merged PRs by their merge time, and how it is implemented in the `organise_prs` function, involves the following steps:

1. **Collect Merged PRs**: The function initializes an empty list `prs_merged` to store merged pull requests (PRs).
2. **Collect Merge Times**: Another empty list `merged_at` is initialized to store the times at which the PRs were merged. This list will be used to sort the PRs based on their merge times.

The actual sorting is not shown in the provided code snippet. Typically, after collecting the PRs and their merge times, the `prs_merged` and `merged_at` lists would be sorted in ascending order (from oldest to most recent merge time) using a sorting algorithm such as `sorted()` in Python, which is efficient for this task. 

Here is a possible way to implement the sorting within the function:

```python
prs_merged_sorted = sorted(prs_merged, key=lambda pr: merged_at[prs_merged.index(pr)])
```

This line sorts `prs_merged` based on the corresponding merge time in `merged_at`, ensuring that the PRs are ordered from the oldest to the most recent merge.

---

**Question:** What does the code do if a pull request (PR) is not merged?

**Answer:** If a pull request (PR) is not merged, the code checks the PR's state. If the state is 'open', the PR is added to the 'prs_open' list along with its 'updated_at' timestamp. If the state is 'closed', the PR is added to the 'prs_closed' list with its 'updated_at' timestamp.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of sorting the merged PRs by their merged timestamp and how is this sorting implemented?

**Answer:** The purpose of sorting the merged PRs by their merged timestamp is to order the pull requests based on when they were merged, from the earliest to the latest merge time. This sorting is implemented by first collecting the merged PRs and their merge timestamps into lists. Then, the merged PRs are sorted using the `sorted` function with a custom key, where the key is formed by pairing each PR with its corresponding merge timestamp from the `merged_at` list. The `zip` function is used to combine the two lists into a list of pairs, which is then passed to the `sorted` function. The sorted pairs are unpacked back into the `prs_merged` list, ensuring the PRs are in chronological order of their merge timestamps.

---

**Question:** What is the final step in the process described in the document, and how does it ensure that the PRs are sorted correctly based on their state?

**Answer:** The final step in the process is the sorting of the PRs based on their state. For merged PRs, the sorting is done by their merged timestamp, resulting in `prs_merged` being ordered from the earliest to the latest merge. Similarly, `prs_closed` is sorted by `closed_updated_at`, and `prs_open` is sorted by `open_updated_at`. This ensures that the PRs are correctly ordered according to their respective timestamps, facilitating easy access to the most recent updates for each state.

**Question:** What does the `get_prs` function return?

**Answer:** The `get_prs` function does not directly return a value in the provided document. However, based on the structure and purpose of the function, it appears to collect pull requests (PRs) from a GitHub repository and process them into a list. The function does not return this list directly but rather processes it into a dictionary with keys 'merged', 'closed', and 'open'. Therefore, it can be inferred that the function implicitly returns this dictionary, even though it is not explicitly stated in the provided code snippet.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `get_prs` function and how does it filter the pull requests based on the `pr_state` parameter?

**Answer:** The `get_prs` function is designed to retrieve pull requests (PRs) from a specified GitHub repository based on certain criteria. It filters PRs based on the `pr_state` parameter, which allows the function to narrow down the results to either 'open', 'closed', or 'merged' PRs. If `pr_state` is provided, it is appended to the API request URL in the format `state=<pr_state>`. For instance, if `pr_state` is set to 'closed', the function will fetch only closed PRs from the repository. If `pr_state` is not provided, the function will fetch both open and closed PRs by setting `state=all`.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `has_error` variable in the `get_prs` function, and how is it used within the function?

**Answer:** The `has_error` variable in the `get_prs` function is not actually utilized within the provided code snippet. It is declared but not assigned or checked for any value changes. This suggests that the variable was perhaps intended for tracking errors but was never implemented or integrated into the error handling mechanism of the function. 

Given the current implementation, the function does not check for errors in the `response` objects obtained from the GitHub API, which are expected to be stored in a list called `prs_return`. Therefore, `has_error` does not play a role in the function as written.

---

**Question:** What will happen if the request to the GitHub API is not successful?

**Answer:** If the request to the GitHub API is not successful, the code will print an error message indicating the status code and the text of the response, set the has_error variable to True, and then break out of the loop, preventing further processing of PRs.

---

**Question:** What happens if the request to the GitHub API is not successful (i.e., the status code is not 200)?

**Answer:** If the request to the GitHub API is not successful (i.e., the status code is not 200), the code will print an error message indicating the status code and the text of the response, like this: 'Failed to retrieve data: [status_code] - [response.text]'. Furthermore, the variable 'has_error' is set to True, and the loop is exited using 'break'.

---

**Question:** What specific condition must be met for a pull request to be included in the `prs_return` list, and how is this condition checked in the code?

**Answer:** For a pull request to be included in the `prs_return` list, it must have at least one label that matches a label specified in the `request_labels` list. This condition is checked by iterating through each label associated with the pull request and comparing its name to the labels in `request_labels`. If a match is found, the `take_pr` flag is set to `True`, indicating that the pull request should be included. If no matching label is found, the pull request is skipped.

---

**Question:** What will be the output if the `accept_suffix` is not provided when calling `separate_labels_request_accept(labels)`?

**Answer:** If the `accept_suffix` is not provided when calling `separate_labels_request_accept(labels)`, all labels will be considered request labels and no labels will be categorized as accepted. The output will be a list containing all the provided labels and an empty list for accepted labels.

---

**Question:** What does the function `separate_labels_request_accept` do when `accept_suffix` is not provided?

**Answer:** When the `accept_suffix` is not provided, all labels are considered request labels and no labels are classified as accepted labels.

---

**Question:** What specific steps are taken in the `separate_labels_request_accept` function to distinguish between labels and labels with the `-accepted` suffix, and how does the function handle the case when `accept_suffix` is not provided?

**Answer:** The `separate_labels_request_accept` function distinguishes between labels and labels with the `-accepted` suffix by iterating through the provided `labels` list. It categorizes the labels into two separate lists: `labels_request` for labels that do not end with `-accepted`, and `labels_accept` for those that do.

If the `accept_suffix` parameter is not provided, all labels are classified as request labels, meaning `labels_request` will contain all the labels and `labels_accept` will remain empty.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `labels_request` and `labels_accept` lists in the given code?

**Answer:** The `labels_request` and `labels_accept` lists in the given code are used to categorize labels based on a specified suffix. Labels that end with the `accept_suffix` are appended to `labels_accept`, while other labels are added to `labels_request`. This separation helps in distinguishing between labels that meet a certain criterion (accepted labels) and those that do not (request labels) for further processing or reporting purposes.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `common_header` variable in the `make_report` function, and what does it contain?

**Answer:** The `common_header` variable in the `make_report` function serves as a standard header for each table generated in the report. It contains a markdown table definition with column headers for Requestor, Package, PR, PR title, State, Merged at, and Data or MC.

---

**Question:** What is the structure of the `rows_per_label` dictionary after the loop that iterates over `all_prs.items()`?

**Answer:** The `rows_per_label` dictionary will have keys corresponding to each label in `labels_request`, and the values will be empty lists. Specifically, for each label in `labels_request`, there will be an entry in `rows_per_label` with an associated value of an empty list.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `rows_per_label` dictionary in this code snippet?

**Answer:** The `rows_per_label` dictionary is used to store rows of data associated with each label. It is initialized as a dictionary where the keys are the labels specified in `labels_request`, and the values are empty lists for each label. This structure allows the code to collect and organize rows of information related to specific labels, facilitating the creation of tables or summaries where each label has its own set of rows in the output.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `labels_take` list in the given code snippet, and how is it used?

**Answer:** The `labels_take` list in the code snippet is used to collect the labels for which the table should consider a particular pull request (PR). This list is populated as part of the loop that iterates over the pull requests, with the intention of determining which PRs should be included in the table based on their associated labels. However, the specific usage of this list is not detailed in the provided code snippet; it is implied that after collecting the relevant labels, they will be used to filter or include PRs in some manner, likely for generating a table or report.

---

**Question:** What specific conditions or criteria are used to determine which labels the PR should be taken into account for, and how are these conditions implemented in the code snippet?

**Answer:** In the provided code snippet, the labels for which a PR (pull request) should be taken into account are not explicitly defined or set within the snippet itself. The code initializes an empty list for `labels_take` but does not specify any conditions or criteria for populating this list. The specific conditions or criteria for determining which labels a PR should be taken into account for are not implemented in the given code. To determine the labels for which a PR should be included, one would need to look at the code that follows the snippet provided.

---

**Question:** What will happen if there are no labels of interest in a pull request?

**Answer:** If there are no labels of interest in a pull request, the code will continue to the next iteration without including this pull request in the report.

---

**Question:** What condition ensures that a pull request (PR) is included in the report based on its labels?

**Answer:** A pull request (PR) is included in the report based on its labels if it meets the following conditions:
1. It contains at least one label that is in the `labels_request` list.
2. This label is either 'mc' or 'data', and the PR has the corresponding assigned label.
3. If `label_accept_suffix` is not `None` and there is no label in the PR that matches the format of the requested label followed by the suffix (e.g., `label_name-label_accept_suffix`), the PR is still included in the report if the requested label is the only relevant one found.
4. The PR must have at least one label that is of interest to the report. If no such label is found after checking all the conditions, the PR is excluded from the report.

---

**Question:** What conditions must be met for a pull request (PR) to be included in the report, considering the logic implemented in the given code snippet?

**Answer:** For a pull request (PR) to be included in the report, it must meet the following conditions based on the logic in the code snippet:

1. The PR must contain at least one label that matches a label in `labels_request`.
2. If the label is either 'mc' or 'data', the PR must also have the corresponding accepted label (e.g., 'mc-accepted' if 'mc' is present).
3. The PR must not contain any labels that are flagged as not to be taken into account, unless there is a corresponding accepted label present.
4. The PR must have at least one label that is considered of interest and that is not excluded based on the specified conditions.

**Question:** What is the format of each row in the report?

**Answer:** Each row in the report is formatted as a markdown string containing the following elements:

- A user login: `| {user_login} |`
- A repository name: `| {repo} |`
- A link to the pull request: `| [PR]({pr["html_url"]}) |`
- The pull request title: `| {pr["title"]} |`
- The pull request state: `| {state} |`
- The merge status: `| {merged_at} |`
- The relevant MC or DATA label: `| {mc_data} |`

---

**Question:** What information is included in the rows appended to `rows_per_label[label]` for each label, and how is the `mc_data` field determined?

**Answer:** The rows appended to `rows_per_label[label]` include the following information:

- User login
- Repository name
- Pull Request link
- Pull Request title
- Pull Request state
- Merged status
- MC and DATA label(s)

The `mc_data` field is determined as follows:
- If `mc_data` is provided, it is joined into a comma-separated string.
- If no specific `mc_data` is provided, it defaults to 'MC,DATA'.

---

**Question:** What specific information is appended to the rows for each label in the report, and how is the `mc_data` variable determined?

**Answer:** Each row for a label in the report is appended with the following information:
- User login
- Repository name
- Pull Request URL
- Pull Request title
- Pull Request state
- Merged at timestamp
- MC and DATA label, determined by the `mc_data` variable

The `mc_data` variable is determined as follows:
- If `mc_data` is present, its values are joined with commas and assigned to `mc_data`
- If `mc_data` is not present, 'MC,DATA' is assigned to `mc_data`

**Question:** What is the default number of results per page when fetching closed pull requests with the provided script?

**Answer:** The default number of results per page when fetching closed pull requests with the provided script is 100.

---

**Question:** What is the default value of the `--per-page` argument and what does it represent in the context of retrieving pull requests?

**Answer:** The default value of the `--per-page` argument is 100. This represents the number of results per page when retrieving pull requests from the GitHub repository.

---

**Question:** What specific conditions must be met for a closed pull request to be retrieved by this script, and how can these conditions be controlled through command-line arguments?

**Answer:** To retrieve a closed pull request with specific conditions using this script, the pull request must be closed and have a certain label. These conditions can be controlled through the following command-line arguments:

- `--owner`: Set the GitHub repository owner, default is 'AliceO2Group'.
- `--repo`: Specify the GitHub repository name, which is required.
- `--pr-state` or `--pr-state`: Define the state of the pull request. This argument is optional.
- `--output`: Provide a name for the output file where the report will be saved.
- `--per-page` or `--per_page`: Determine the number of results per page, default is 100.
- `--start-page` or `--start_page`: Indicate the starting page, default is 1.
- `--pages`: Specify the number of pages to retrieve, default is 5.

By setting these arguments appropriately, you can control which closed pull requests with specific labels are retrieved by the script.

---

**Question:** What is the default number of pages specified in the argument parser?

**Answer:** The default number of pages specified in the argument parser is 5.

---

**Question:** What is the default value of the `--label-accepted-suffix` argument, and what is the expected format of an accepted label based on this value?

**Answer:** The default value of the `--label-accepted-suffix` argument is 'accepted'. An accepted label is expected to have the form `<request-label>-<accepted-suffix>`, so based on the default value, an accepted label would look like `<request-label>-accepted`.

---

**Question:** What would happen to the fetched pull requests if the `--include-accepted` flag is not set?

**Answer:** If the `--include-accepted` flag is not set, only pull requests (PRs) are fetched where at least one label does not have an associated "accepted" label. This means that PRs having any label ending with "-accepted" will be excluded from the fetched results.

---

**Question:** What does the script do if no pull requests are found with the specified labels?

**Answer:** The script prints '==> There are no PRs to report.' and exits with code 0 if no pull requests are found with the specified labels.

---

**Question:** How does the script handle the case when no pull requests are found with the specified labels?

**Answer:** The script checks if the retrieved pull requests list `prs` is empty. If no pull requests are found, it prints the message '==> There are no PRs to report.' and exits with a status code of 0.

---

**Question:** What specific action is taken if no pull requests are found with the specified labels when the script is executed?

**Answer:** If no pull requests are found with the specified labels when the script is executed, it prints the message '==> There are no PRs to report.' and exits with a status code of 0.
