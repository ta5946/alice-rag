**Question:** What specific configuration file is used for the krypton clusterer workflow component, and how many lanes does it process?

**Answer:** The krypton clusterer workflow component uses the configuration file "/home/wiechula/processData/inputFilesTracking/krypton/krBoxCluster.largeBox.cuts.krMap.ini" and processes 5 lanes.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `if` statement in the given script and how does it affect the value of `NLANES`?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `if` statement in the given script is to check whether the environment variable `TPC_KRYPTON_LANES` is set (i.e., not empty). If the variable is set, the value of `NLANES` is assigned to the value of `TPC_KRYPTON_LANES`. If the variable is not set, `NLANES` retains its previous value (or is not set if it was previously undefined). This allows for the dynamic assignment of the number of lanes (`NLANES`) based on the value of `TPC_KRYPTON_LANES`, potentially enabling the script to adapt to different configurations or environments where the number of lanes might vary.

**Question:** What is the default value of the variable `NLANES` if it is not set by the environment variable `TPC_KRYPTON_LANES`?

**Answer:** The default value of the variable `NLANES` if it is not set by the environment variable `TPC_KRYPTON_LANES` is 36.
