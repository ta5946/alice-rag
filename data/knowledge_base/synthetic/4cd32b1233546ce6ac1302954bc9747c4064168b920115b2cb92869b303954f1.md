**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed "s/| */|\n/g"` command in the script?

**Answer:** The `sed "s/| */|\n/g"` command in the script is used to transform the workflow command, specifically to replace multiple spaces following a pipe symbol (|) with a newline character (\n). This transformation facilitates a cleaner display of the assembled command by formatting each pipe-separated element into a new line, making the command easier to read and understand.
