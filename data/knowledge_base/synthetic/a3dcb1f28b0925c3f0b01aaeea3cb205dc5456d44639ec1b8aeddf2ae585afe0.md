**Answer:** The value of REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_GOOD is "GOOD".

---

**Question:** Which interpretation code would you use if the relative value is not critical but still noteworthy?

**Answer:** REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_NONCRIT_NC

---

**Question:** What is the significance of the `REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_NONCRIT_NC` value in the context of relative validity interpretations, and how does it differ from `REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_CRIT_NC`?

**Answer:** The `REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_NONCRIT_NC` value signifies a non-critical non-conformance in the context of relative validity interpretations. This means that while the measurement or data does not fully meet the specified criteria, it is not considered severe enough to be critical. 

In contrast, `REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_CRIT_NC` indicates a critical non-conformance, suggesting that the data or measurement is significantly deviating from the expected criteria and could have a substantial impact on the validity and reliability of the results. The critical nature of `REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_CRIT_NC` implies that actions need to be taken to address the deviation promptly, as it may compromise the overall outcome.

**Question:** What is the color mapping for the REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_BAD severity in the REL_VAL_SEVERITY_COLOR_MAP dictionary, and how does it relate to the severity levels defined in REL_VAL_SEVERITIES?

**Answer:** The color mapping for the REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_BAD severity in the REL_VAL_SEVERITY_COLOR_MAP dictionary is "red". This color is assigned to indicate the highest severity level among the defined interpretations. In the REL_VAL_SEVERITIES list, REL_VAL_INTERPRETATION_BAD is the last and most critical entry, signifying a severe issue that requires immediate attention.
