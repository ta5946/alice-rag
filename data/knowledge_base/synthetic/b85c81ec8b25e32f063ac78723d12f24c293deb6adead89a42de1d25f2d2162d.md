## Content

**Question:** What is the purpose of the script described in this document?

**Answer:** The purpose of the script is to produce a local shell script that emulates the execution of an ALIEN JDL on the GRID, aiding in the local debugging of failing GRID jobs.

---

**Question:** What steps does the script take to produce a local shell script from an ALIEN JDL file?

**Answer:** The script first imports necessary modules. It then sets up an argument parser to accept command-line arguments for the JDL file, output filename, and an optional process ID. When the JDL file is provided, the script scrapes the JDL content. If a process ID is given instead, it retrieves the JDL from ALIEN using that ID. Finally, it generates a local shell script based on the JDL content, which can be used for local execution and debugging of GRID jobs.

**Question:** What specific steps would you take to modify this script to handle multiple JDL files and generate separate shell scripts for each one?

**Answer:** To modify this script to handle multiple JDL files and generate separate shell scripts for each one, you would need to:

1. Change the argument to accept a list of JDL files, instead of a single file. This can be done by changing the `--jdl` argument to `--jdl` or `--jdl-list` to accept a comma-separated list or a list of files.

2. Parse the list of JDL files provided by the user.

3. For each JDL file, generate a separate shell script, using a loop to iterate over the list of JDL files.

4. Inside the loop, use the existing logic to create the shell script for each JDL file, ensuring that the output filename is unique for each JDL file.

5. Optionally, allow the user to specify an output directory where the shell scripts should be saved.

Here's a possible implementation of these steps:

```python
import argparse
import os, stat
import subprocess

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Produce local shell scripts from ALIEN JDL files')
parser.add_argument('--jdl', type=str, help="A local JDL file or list of JDL files separated by commas")
parser.add_argument('-o', type=str, help="output directory to save the shell scripts to")
args = parser.parse_args()

# Convert the comma-separated string to a list
if args.jdl:
    jdl_files = args.jdl.split(',')
else:
    jdl_files = []

# Output directory handling
output_dir = args.o or os.getcwd()
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

for jdl_file in jdl_files:
    # Extract the filename from the JDL file path
    jdl_filename = os.path.basename(jdl_file)
    
    # Generate the output filename by appending .sh to the JDL filename
    output_filename = os.path.join(output_dir, os.path.splitext(jdl_filename)[0] + '.sh')
    
    # Use the existing logic to generate the shell script
    with open(output_filename, 'w') as shell_script:
        # Add the generated shell script content here
        shell_script.write("#!/bin/bash\n")
        shell_script.write("echo 'Generated from JDL: {}\n'".format(jdl_file))
    
    # Ensure the shell script is executable
    os.chmod(output_filename, stat.S_IRWXU)
```

This modified script will process a list of JDL files and create a separate shell script for each one in the specified output directory.

**Question:** What does the `toList` function do when it receives a token that starts and ends with '{}' and contains comma-separated values?

**Answer:** The `toList` function, when given a token that starts and ends with '{}' and contains comma-separated values, first removes the curly braces. It then splits the remaining string by commas, trims any leading or trailing whitespace from each split element, and returns the resulting list of cleaned strings.

---

**Question:** What modifications would you make to the `cleanFileName` function to also remove the character 'LF:' from the beginning of the filename if it exists?

**Answer:** def cleanFileName(filename):
  # remove " and 'LF:' from alien file names
  filename = filename.replace('LF:','').replace('"','')
  if filename.startswith('LF:'):
    filename = filename[3:]
  return filename

---

**Question:** What potential issue could arise from using the `toList` function if the input token contains a comma within a string?

**Answer:** If the input token contains a comma within a string, the `toList` function might incorrectly split the string into multiple elements. This is because the function splits the token by commas without checking if the commas are within quotes.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `removeQuote` function?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `removeQuote` function is to replace all occurrences of double quotation marks (") with an empty string, effectively removing them from the input token.

---

**Question:** What does the `parseJDL` function return if the provided `jdlfile` is either `None` or an empty string?

**Answer:** The `parseJDL` function returns an empty dictionary if the provided `jdlfile` is either `None` or an empty string.

---

**Question:** What would happen if the `alien.py ps --jdl` command fails and returns a non-zero exit code?

**Answer:** If the `alien.py ps --jdl` command fails and returns a non-zero exit code, the `fetchJDL` function would print 'Fetching failed. Make sure to have access to jalien' and return None.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `flatjdl` variable in the given code?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `flatjdl` variable is to store a single string that concatenates all non-LPMMetaData lines from the opened file, with newline characters stripped. This consolidation eliminates the need to work with multiple lines and prepares the content for further tokenization into individual statements based on semicolons.

**Question:** What does the `constructRuntimeScript` function do and how does it handle the package list from the JDL file?

**Answer:** The `constructRuntimeScript` function generates a bash script for running the JDL file locally. It handles the package list from the JDL file by converting it into a string using the `toList` function and then joining the list elements with commas. The function appends commands to the script to instantiate the appropriate software environment using the packages specified in the JDL. Specifically, it prints the environment variables for the given packages to a file named "environment" and then sources this file to activate the required environment.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `constructRuntimeScript` function and how does it ensure the correct software environment is instantiated?

**Answer:** The `constructRuntimeScript` function generates a bash script to run a job locally, ensuring the correct software environment is instantiated. It does this by:

1. Starting the script with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to indicate it is a bash script.
2. Extracting the list of packages specified in the job definition (`Packages` key in `jdldict`) using the `toList` function.
3. Creating a comma-separated string of these package names.
4. Appending commands to the script to use `alienv` to print environment variables for the specified packages, redirecting the output to a file named `environment`.
5. Adding a `source environment` command to load the environment variables from the `environment` file, thereby setting up the correct software environment for the job.

This process ensures that the job runs in the intended software environment, as defined in the JDL file.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the line `script.append("chmod +x " + nopathexec)` in the script?

**Answer:** The line `script.append("chmod +x " + nopathexec)` in the script is intended to make the executable file, from which the script name is derived, writable and executable. This is necessary to allow the script to run the executable after it has been copied to the local environment from the alien file store. The command `chmod +x` changes the file mode bits of the specified file, and by using `nopathexec` (which is the executable file name with its path removed), the script ensures that the correct executable is marked as both writable and executable, enabling its subsequent execution via `./nopathexec`.

---

**Question:** What command is used to make the executable file executable and why is this step necessary?

**Answer:** The command used to make the executable file executable is `chmod +x <nopathexec>`. This step is necessary because in Unix-like operating systems, an executable file needs to have the execute permission set for the user, group, or others to be able to run it. The `chmod +x` command adds the execute permission, ensuring the script can invoke the executable properly.

---

**Question:** What specific command is used to export the value of a JDL variable with a custom name, and how is the variable name transformed during this process?

**Answer:** The specific command used to export the value of a JDL variable with a custom name is "export". During this process, the variable name is transformed by first removing any surrounding quotes using the `removeQuote` function, then having any leading or trailing whitespace stripped off with `lstrip().rstrip()`, and finally, the modified variable name is concatenated with "ALIEN_JDL_" to form the full export command.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `convertToScript` function?

**Answer:** The `convertToScript` function writes a script encoded in a line by line list to a specified output file. It first opens the file in write mode, then iterates over each line in the list, writing it to the file followed by a newline character. After writing all lines, it closes the file and makes the file executable using an os.system call to change its permissions.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `convertToScript` function and what steps does it take to make the output file executable?

**Answer:** The `convertToScript` function is designed to take a line-by-line list representing a script and write it to a file specified by `outfilename`. It performs the following steps to make the output file executable:

1. It opens the file in write mode.
2. If the file is successfully opened, it iterates over each line in the `scriptlist`, appending each line to the file followed by a newline character.
3. After writing all lines, it closes the file.
4. It then uses `os.system` to execute the command `chmod +x outfilename`, which grants execute permissions to the file, making it executable.
5. Additionally, it attempts to set more complex permissions using `os.chmod(outfilename, stat.S_IEXEC | stat.S_IXGRP | stat.S_IXOTH)`, ensuring the file is executable by the owner, group, and others.

---

**Question:** What specific steps are taken to ensure the constructed script is executable and what is the rationale behind the chosen method?

**Answer:** To ensure the constructed script is executable, the following steps are taken:

1. The `convertToScript` function writes the scriptlist to a file specified by `outfilename`.
2. After writing the content, the script uses `os.system("chmod +x " + outfilename)` to set the execute permission on the file.

The rationale behind this method is to make the script directly executable by users without additional chmod commands. By explicitly adding execute permissions with `chmod +x`, it simplifies the process for users and ensures compatibility across different systems. However, the commented-out line `os.chmod(outfilename, stat.S_IEXEC | stat.S_IXUSR)` provides an alternative method that can be used for more granular permissions control, although it is not employed in the provided code.
