**Question:** What specific command-line argument is used to set the number of CPU cores for parallel processing in the O2 DPG workflow, and what is the impact of increasing this value on the workflow execution?

**Answer:** The specific command-line argument used to set the number of CPU cores for parallel processing in the O2 DPG workflow is --cpu-limit. In the provided command example, --cpu-limit 32 is used to allow an increased timeframe parallelism with 32 CPU cores.

Increasing this value can positively impact the workflow execution by potentially reducing the overall processing time, as more parallel tasks can be executed simultaneously. However, the effectiveness of this improvement depends on the nature of the tasks within the workflow and the underlying hardware capabilities.
