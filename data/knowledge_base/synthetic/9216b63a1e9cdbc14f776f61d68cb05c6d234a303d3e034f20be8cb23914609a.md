**Question:** What is the default number of workers set for the simulation if not specified otherwise?

**Answer:** The default number of workers set for the simulation, if not specified otherwise, is 8.

**Question:** What configuration key is used to set the diamond detector width in the simulation, and what is its value?

**Answer:** The configuration key used to set the diamond detector width in the simulation is "Diamond.width[2]", and its value is set to 6.

**Question:** What specific simulation engine and number of workers are used in the workflow for simulating pp min bias events with a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV?

**Answer:** The specific simulation engine used in the workflow is TGeant4, and the number of workers is 8.

**Question:** What does the `-tt aod` option do in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command?

**Answer:** The `-tt aod` option in the `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` command specifies that the task type to be executed is AOD (Analysis Object Data). This indicates the workflow will generate and process analysis objects, which are data structures used for further analysis and extraction of physics results from the raw event data.

**Question:** What is the impact of setting the --cpu-limit parameter to 32 on the parallelism of the workflow execution?

**Answer:** Setting the --cpu-limit parameter to 32 allows for increased parallelism in the workflow execution timeframe. This means that the workflow can utilize up to 32 CPU cores simultaneously, enhancing the speed and efficiency of the parallel tasks being processed.

**Question:** What specific configuration changes would you need to make to the workflow if you wanted to process both AOD and PED output types simultaneously, given the current setup processes only AOD type?

**Answer:** To process both AOD and PED output types simultaneously in the given setup, you would need to modify the command line invocation of the workflow runner. Specifically, you should include both output types in the `-tt` option. The modified command would look like this:

```
${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod,ped --cpu-limit ${CPU_LIMIT}
```

This change allows the workflow to produce both AOD and PED output types by specifying them as a comma-separated list in the `-tt` option.
