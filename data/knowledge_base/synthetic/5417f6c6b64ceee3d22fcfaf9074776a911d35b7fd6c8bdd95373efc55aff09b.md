**Question:** What are the event numbers used in step 1 and step 2 of the simulation process described in the document?

**Answer:** The event numbers used in step 1 and step 2 of the simulation process are 100 for step 1 and 1 for step 2.

**Question:** What specific function and file are used to define the selective particle transport in the simulation, and how does the `transportPrimaryInvert` parameter affect this process?

**Answer:** The specific function and file used to define the selective particle transport in the simulation are `transportPDG(321)` from the file `transportPDG.macro`. The `transportPrimaryInvert` parameter, when set to `false`, means that the transport will be enabled for the selected particles. If it is set to `true`, the transport will be inhibited for the selected particles.

**Question:** What specific trigger condition is required for the propagation of all remaining tracks in this simulation step?

**Answer:** The specific trigger condition required for the propagation of all remaining tracks in this simulation step is that both photons from the pi0 decay must have converted within a given region.
