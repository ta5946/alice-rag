**Question:** What are the specific command-line arguments used for the background process in the simulation script, and what is the purpose of the "--mft-assessment-full" and "--fwdmatching-assessment-full" flags?

**Answer:** The specific command-line arguments used for the background process in the simulation script are:
- `-genBkg pythia8` - Specifies the background generator as Pythia8.
- `-procBkg inel` - Processes the background events as inelastic.
- `-colBkg pp` - Specifies the collision system as proton-proton.
- `--embedding` - Indicates that the simulation includes embedded events.
- `--mft-assessment-full` - Enables a full assessment of the Mid-Frame Tracker (MFT) performance.
- `--fwdmatching-assessment-full` - Enables a full assessment of forward matching, which is crucial for understanding the interactions and their reconstruction at the boundaries of the detector.

The purpose of the `--mft-assessment-full` and `--fwdmatching-assessment-full` flags is to comprehensively evaluate the performance and accuracy of the MFT and the forward matching algorithms in the simulation. This assessment helps in optimizing the detector response and ensuring that the reconstructed events correctly reflect the physical interactions, particularly at the boundaries of the detector where the MFT and forward regions interface.
