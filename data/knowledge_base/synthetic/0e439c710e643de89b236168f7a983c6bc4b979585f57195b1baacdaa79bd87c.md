**Question:** What is the default value of the `NGPURECOTHREADS` variable when it is not explicitly set in the script?

**Answer:** The default value of the `NGPURECOTHREADS` variable when it is not explicitly set in the script is `-1`, which indicates auto-detection.

---

**Question:** What is the default value of `NGPURECOTHREADS` and under what condition would it be set to a specific value instead of auto-detecting?

**Answer:** The default value of `NGPURECOTHREADS` is set to -1, which indicates that it will auto-detect the number of threads. This value is explicitly set using the assignment `: ${NGPURECOTHREADS:=-1}`. An exception to this auto-detection is when the environment variable `NGPURECOTHREADS` is provided with a specific value by the user, in which case that value will be used instead of auto-detection.

---

**Question:** What does the variable `NGPURECOTHREADS` default to and what is the significance of the `-1` value?

**Answer:** The variable `NGPURECOTHREADS` defaults to `-1`. The significance of the `-1` value is that it indicates auto-detection, meaning the system will automatically determine the appropriate number of threads for GPU-based reconstruction processes.

**Question:** What is the value of the variable `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` based on the given conditions and assuming `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW` is 200 and `NUMAGPUIDS` is 0?

**Answer:** The value of the variable `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` is calculated as 200 * 1, since `NUMAGPUIDS` is 0. Therefore, `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` equals 200.

---

**Question:** What is the value of the variable `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` when `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW` is 250 and there are 2 NUMA domains?

**Answer:** The value of `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` when `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW` is 250 and there are 2 NUMA domains is 500.

Explanation:
Given that `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW` is 250 and is greater than 15, the condition `($RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW > 15)` evaluates to true. The next condition `($RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW < 230)` also evaluates to false because 250 is not less than 230. However, the condition allows for a maximum value of 230 when it is not less than 230. Therefore, `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW` is set to 230.

Since `NUMAGPUIDS` is not explicitly defined as zero, the condition `($NUMAGPUIDS != 0 ? 2 : 1)` evaluates to 2. Therefore, the final value of `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` is calculated as `230 * 2`, which equals 500.

**Answer:** The value of `NGPURECOTHREADS` when running with the `pp_4gpu` optimization setting is not explicitly stated in the provided configuration. However, the `pp_4gpu` optimization setting is associated with a block of conditions and default values. Since the `NGPURECOTHREADS` variable is only defined within the `pp_1gpu` and `pp_4gpu` blocks, and the `pp_4gpu` block does not override the value of `NGPURECOTHREADS` from the `pp_1gpu` block, the value of `NGPURECOTHREADS` remains at 8 when running with the `pp_4gpu` optimization setting.

**Answer:** The value of N_ITSRAWDEC when EPNPIPELINES is 4, BEAMTYPE is "pp", and the number of GPUs (NGPUS) is 8 is calculated as follows:

N_ITSRAWDEC = math_max(6 * EPNPIPELINES * NGPUS / 4, 1)
             = math_max(6 * 4 * 8 / 4, 1)
             = math_max(48 / 4, 1)
             = math_max(12, 1)
             = 12

Therefore, N_ITSRAWDEC is 12.

---

**Question:** What is the value of N_ITSTRK when the BEAMTYPE is "PbPb"?

**Answer:** The value of N_ITSTRK is determined by the expression $(math_max $((4 * $EPNPIPELINES * $NGPUS / 4)) 1). This expression first calculates 4 times the product of EPNPIPELINES and NGPUS, then divides the result by 4, and finally applies the math_max function to ensure the value is at least 1.

---

**Question:** What is the formula used to calculate the number of TPC raw decoders (N_TPCRAWDEC) in the given script?

**Answer:** The formula used to calculate the number of TPC raw decoders (N_TPCRAWDEC) in the given script is:

N_TPCRAWDEC=$(math_max $((12 * $EPNPIPELINES * $NGPUS / 4)) 1)

---

**Question:** What is the formula used to calculate the number of TPC raw decoders (N_TPCRAWDEC) and how does it differ for CPU-based systems?

**Answer:** The formula used to calculate the number of TPC raw decoders (N_TPCRAWDEC) is:

N_TPCRAWDEC=$(math_max $((12 * $EPNPIPELINES * $NGPUS / 4)) 1)

This formula scales the value based on the number of EPNPIPELINES and NGPUS. For CPU-based systems, there is a different calculation:

N_TPCTRK=8

In this case, the number is directly set to 8, bypassing the formula that involves EPNPIPELINES and NGPUS.

---

**Question:** What is the minimum number of ITS RAW decoders required when using 60 EPN nodes, and how does this number change if the number of NUMA domains is increased?

**Answer:** When using 60 EPN nodes, the minimum number of ITS RAW decoders required is 3. If the number of NUMA domains is increased, this number will be scaled down by a factor of two automatically.

---

**Question:** What is the minimum number of ITS RAW decoders required when using 60 EPN nodes, and how does this number change if the number of NUMA domains is doubled?

**Answer:** When using 60 EPN nodes, the minimum number of ITS RAW decoders required is 3. If the number of NUMA domains is doubled, this number will be automatically scaled down by a factor of two, resulting in 1.5 decoders. Since the number of decoders must be an integer, it would be rounded down to 1.

**Question:** What is the minimum value that N_MFTTRK can take?

**Answer:** The minimum value that N_MFTTRK can take is 1.

---

**Question:** What is the minimum value that N_MFTTRK will be set to based on the given script and the number of nodes in the workflow?

**Answer:** The minimum value that N_MFTTRK will be set to is 1, as the script ensures that N_MFTTRK is at least 1 by using the ${N_MFTTRK:-1} syntax, which defaults to 1 if N_MFTTRK is not set or is set to a value less than 1.

---

**Question:** What is the mathematical expression used to calculate the value of `N_MFTTRK` and how does it change if the `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` variable is doubled?

**Answer:** The mathematical expression used to calculate the value of `N_MFTTRK` is:

`math_max $((1 * 60 / $RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP)) ${N_MFTTRK:-1}`

If the `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` variable is doubled, the expression becomes:

`math_max $((1 * 60 / (2 * $RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP))) ${N_MFTTRK:-1}`

Simplifying this, we get:

`math_max $((30 / $RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP)) ${N_MFTTRK:-1}`

This means that doubling `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` would halve the result of the division, thus potentially increasing the value of `N_MFTTRK` by a factor of 2, unless the resulting value is less than 1, in which case it will be capped at 1.

---

**Question:** What is the value of `EVE_NTH_EVENT` for PbPb collisions when `EPN_GLOBAL_SCALING` is set to 1.5 and `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` is 1000?

**Answer:** The value of `EVE_NTH_EVENT` for PbPb collisions when `EPN_GLOBAL_SCALING` is set to 1.5 and `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` is 1000 is calculated as follows:

1. From the document, when `BEAMTYPE == "PbPb"`, `EVE_NTH_EVENT` is set to 2.
2. The document also states that if `EPN_GLOBAL_SCALING` is not empty, `EVE_NTH_EVENT` is multiplied by `EPN_GLOBAL_SCALING`.
3. Given that `EPN_GLOBAL_SCALING` is set to 1.5, we multiply 2 by 1.5, resulting in 3.

Therefore, `EVE_NTH_EVENT` is 3.
