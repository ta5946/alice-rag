**Question:** What is the default value of the `NGPURECOTHREADS` variable when it is not explicitly set in the script?

**Answer:** The default value of the `NGPURECOTHREADS` variable when it is not explicitly set in the script is `-1`, which indicates auto-detection.

**Question:** What is the value of NGPURECOTHREADS when OPTIMIZED_PARALLEL_ASYNC is set to "pp_16cpu"?

**Answer:** The value of NGPURECOTHREADS when OPTIMIZED_PARALLEL_ASYNC is set to "pp_16cpu" is 9.

**Question:** What is the minimum number of ITS RAW decoders required when using 60 EPN nodes, and how does this number change if the number of NUMA domains is increased?

**Answer:** When using 60 EPN nodes, the minimum number of ITS RAW decoders required is 3. If the number of NUMA domains is increased, this number will be scaled down by a factor of two automatically.

**Question:** What is the value of `CUT_RANDOM_FRACTION_MCH_WITH_ITS` for PbPb collisions?

**Answer:** The value of `CUT_RANDOM_FRACTION_MCH_WITH_ITS` for PbPb collisions is 0.9.

---

**Question:** What is the value of N_ITSTRK when the beam type is cosmic and there is no high rate proton-proton collision?

**Answer:** N_ITSTRK equals math_max((4 * $EPNPIPELINES * $NGPUS / 4) 1) when the beam type is cosmic and there is no high rate proton-proton collision.

---

**Question:** What is the value of N_ITSRAWDEC if $EPNPIPELINES is 4, $NGPUS is 8, and the system is processing pp or light nuclei data?

**Answer:** The value of N_ITSRAWDEC is calculated as 6 * EPNPIPELINES * NGPUS / 4, which evaluates to 6 * 4 * 8 / 4 = 48.

---

**Question:** What is the value of the variable `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` based on the given conditions and assuming `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW` is 200 and `NUMAGPUIDS` is 0?

**Answer:** The value of the variable `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` is calculated as 200 * 1, since `NUMAGPUIDS` is 0. Therefore, `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` equals 200.

---

**Question:** What is the minimum value that N_MFTTRK will be set to based on the given script and the number of nodes in the workflow?

**Answer:** The minimum value that N_MFTTRK will be set to is 1, as the script ensures that N_MFTTRK is at least 1 by using the ${N_MFTTRK:-1} syntax, which defaults to 1 if N_MFTTRK is not set or is set to a value less than 1.

**Question:** What is the value of `NGPURECOTHREADS` when running with the `pp_4gpu` optimization setting?

**Answer:** The value of `NGPURECOTHREADS` when running with the `pp_4gpu` optimization setting is not explicitly stated in the provided configuration. However, the `pp_4gpu` optimization setting is associated with a block of conditions and default values. Since the `NGPURECOTHREADS` variable is only defined within the `pp_1gpu` and `pp_4gpu` blocks, and the `pp_4gpu` block does not override the value of `NGPURECOTHREADS` from the `pp_1gpu` block, the value of `NGPURECOTHREADS` remains at 8 when running with the `pp_4gpu` optimization setting.

**Question:** What is the formula used to calculate the number of TPC raw decoders (N_TPCRAWDEC) in the given script?

**Answer:** The formula used to calculate the number of TPC raw decoders (N_TPCRAWDEC) in the given script is:

N_TPCRAWDEC=$(math_max $((12 * $EPNPIPELINES * $NGPUS / 4)) 1)

---

**Question:** What is the value of `EVE_NTH_EVENT` for pp collisions when the `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` is 100?

**Answer:** The value of `EVE_NTH_EVENT` for pp collisions when `RECO_NUM_NODES_WORKFLOW_CMP` is 100 is 10.

**Question:** How many threads are allocated for the SVERTEX task when using the configuration "PbPb_4gpu" instead of "PbPb_4gpu_NERSC"?

**Answer:** 20

---

**Question:** How many threads are allocated for TPC track reconstruction when the `OPTIMIZED_PARALLEL_ASYNC` option is set to "PbPb_64cpu"?

**Answer:** 6
