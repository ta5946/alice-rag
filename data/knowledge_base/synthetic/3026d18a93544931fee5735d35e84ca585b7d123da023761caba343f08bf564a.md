**Question:** What command is used to run the O2 DPG workflow for producing AOD output?

**Answer:** The command used to run the O2 DPG workflow for producing AOD output is:

${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -f workflow.json -tt aod  -jmax 1

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `-tt aod` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command?

**Answer:** The `-tt aod` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command specifies the type of output to generate. In this context, `aod` stands for Analysis Object Data, which is a structured format used for analysis in the ALICE experiment. This option directs the workflow to produce AOD files, which contain data objects suitable for further analysis steps.

**Question:** What specific changes would you need to make to the command if you wanted to run the workflow in a mode that produces both AOD and ROOT files instead of just AOD?

**Answer:** ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -f workflow.json -tt aodroot  -jmax 1
