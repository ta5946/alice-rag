**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command used in the script, and how does it transform the input?

**Answer:** The `sed` command is used to transform the input string by replacing multiple occurrences of `| *` with `|` followed by a newline character. This effectively splits the input string into multiple lines, each representing a separate workflow command or option. This transformation makes the workflow more readable when the `print` mode is selected.
