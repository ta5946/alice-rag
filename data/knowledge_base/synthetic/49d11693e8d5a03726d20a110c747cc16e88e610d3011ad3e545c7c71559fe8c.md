**Question:** What are the specific command-line arguments used for the `o2-trd-datareader` workflow, and how do they affect the data processing pipeline?

**Answer:** The `o2-trd-datareader` workflow is configured with the following command-line arguments:

--disable-root-output: This option prevents the generation of ROOT output, which could be useful for reducing the data volume and improving performance by avoiding the creation of ROOT files during the processing.

--every-nth-tf $TRD_REJECTION_FACTOR: This argument specifies that every $TRD_REJECTION_FACTOR-th trigger frame (TF) should be processed. The value of $TRD_REJECTION_FACTOR is used to define the interval at which the data is sampled, which can help in reducing the computational load and managing the data flow.

--pipeline trd-datareader:$TRD_N_READERS: This sets up the pipeline for the TRD (Time Projection Chamber) data reader, indicating that it should use $TRD_N_READERS instances of the data reader. This can be used to distribute the load across multiple readers, improving parallelism and potentially increasing the throughput of the data processing pipeline.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in the given script and how does it affect the output when the `WORKFLOWMODE` is not set to "print"?

**Answer:** The `sed` command in the script is used to format the workflow command string. Specifically, it performs two transformations:

1. It replaces every occurrence of `\\n` with a newline character `\n`.
2. It inserts a newline after each occurrence of `| *` and replaces it with `| \\\n`.

These transformations are applied to the `WORKFLOW` string when the `WORKFLOWMODE` is not set to "print". The formatted output is then echoed to stdout, with the 1>&2 redirection used to send the output to stderr when `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "dds".

**Question:** What is the default value of the TRD_REJECTION_FACTOR if not specified externally?

**Answer:** The default value of the TRD_REJECTION_FACTOR is 4 if not specified externally.
