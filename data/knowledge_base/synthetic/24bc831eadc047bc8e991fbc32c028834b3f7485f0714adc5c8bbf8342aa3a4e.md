**Question:** What does the JDL_OUTPUT variable specify in terms of file locations and types?

**Answer:** The JDL_OUTPUT variable specifies the following file locations and types:

- *.txt files should be stored on disk 1.
- AO2D.root files should be stored on disk 2.
- *.log files should be stored on disk 1.
- *stat* files should be stored on disk 1.
- *.json files should be stored on disk 1.
- debug*tgz* files should be stored on disk 2.

**Question:** What is the value of the `ALIEN_JDL_MCANCHOR` environment variable and how is it set in the script?

**Answer:** The value of the `ALIEN_JDL_MCANCHOR` environment variable is set to `%{PASSNAME}`. This is achieved through the line:

```bash
export ALIEN_JDL_MCANCHOR=%{PASSNAME}
```

**Question:** What is the specific sequence of environment variable exports that are set for the anchoring script, and how do they influence the job configuration in the context of MC production?

**Answer:** The anchoring script sets several environment variables that influence the job configuration for MC production. Specifically, the following environment variables are exported:

- `ALIEN_JDL_LPMPRODUCTIONTYPE=MC` is set to indicate that this is a Monte Carlo (MC) production job.
- `ALIEN_JDL_CPULIMIT=8` defines the CPU limit for the job, setting it to 8 CPU units.
- `ALIEN_JDL_LPMANCHORPASSNAME=%{PASSNAME}` assigns the value of `%{PASSNAME}` to this variable, likely related to the pass name of the anchor being used.
- `ALIEN_JDL_MCANCHOR=%{PASSNAME}` sets the Monte Carlo anchor to the value of `%{PASSNAME}`, which could specify the particular MC anchor being utilized.
- `ALIEN_JDL_COLLISIONSYSTEM=%{COL_SYSTEM}` assigns the collision system to the value of `%{COL_SYSTEM}`, determining the type of collision system the simulation is configured for.
- `ALIEN_JDL_LPMPASSNAME=%{PASSNAME}` sets the LPM (likely a specific job management system) pass name to the value of `%{PASSNAME}`.
- `ALIEN_JDL_LPMRUNNUMBER=%{RUN_NUMBER}` assigns the run number to the value of `%{RUN_NUMBER}`, providing the necessary run identifier for the simulation.
- `ALIEN_JDL_LPMANCHORRUN=%{RUN_NUMBER}` sets the LPM anchor run number to the value of `%{RUN_NUMBER}`, ensuring consistency in run number usage across different anchor stages.

These exports configure the job for MC production, specifying the type of production, resource limitations, anchor and run details, and the collision system, all of which are critical for the simulation setup and execution.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `export ALIEN_JDL_O2DPGWORKFLOWTARGET="aod"` line in the configuration?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `export ALIEN_JDL_O2DPGWORKFLOWTARGET="aod"` line in the configuration is to specify the target workflow for the O2DPG processing, setting it to "aod" which stands for Analysis Object Database. This indicates that the workflow should generate and work with AOD files, which are the final analysis objects used for physics analysis in the ALICE experiment.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `ALIEN_JDL_O2DPGWORKFLOWTARGET` variable and what are the possible values it can take according to the document?

**Answer:** The `ALIEN_JDL_O2DPGWORKFLOWTARGET` variable specifies the target of the O2DPG workflow. According to the document, the only possible value provided for this variable is "aod".

---

**Question:** What is the default value of the `PRODSPLIT` environment variable if it is not specified in the job submission?

**Answer:** The default value of the `PRODSPLIT` environment variable is 100 if it is not specified in the job submission.

**Question:** What action is taken if the environment variable O2DPG_CUSTOM_REPO is set?

**Answer:** If the environment variable O2DPG_CUSTOM_REPO is set, a custom O2DPG repository is checked out from the specified URL. The repository is cloned into a directory named O2DPG. The O2DPG_ROOT and ALIEN_JDL_O2DPG_OVERWRITE environment variables are then set to point to this newly created O2DPG directory.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the environment variable O2DPG_CUSTOM_REPO is set, and what is the impact on the O2DPG installation process?

**Answer:** If the environment variable O2DPG_CUSTOM_REPO is set, the document indicates that a custom O2DPG repository specified by O2DPG_CUSTOM_REPO will be checked out using git. Specifically, the command `git clone "${O2DPG_CUSTOM_REPO}" O2DPG` is executed to clone the repository into a directory named O2DPG. As a result, the O2DPG_ROOT environment variable is set to point to the local clone of the custom repository, and ALIEN_JDL_O2DPG_OVERWRITE is also set to the local O2DPG directory. This process bypasses the use of a released software tag and instead uses the custom repository for the O2DPG installation, potentially allowing for a more customized or experimental setup.

---

**Question:** What specific actions are taken if the O2DPG_CUSTOM_REPO environment variable is set, and how do these actions affect the O2DPG setup process?

**Answer:** If the O2DPG_CUSTOM_REPO environment variable is set, the following actions are taken:

1. A message is printed to the console, indicating that a custom O2DPG repository is being used: "Checking out custom O2DPG repo ${O2DPG_CUSTOM_REPO}".
2. The script uses the `git clone` command to download the specified custom repository into a directory named "O2DPG" in the current working directory.
3. The O2DPG_ROOT environment variable is then set to point to this newly cloned repository: `export O2DPG_ROOT=${PWD}/O2DPG`.
4. The ALIEN_JDL_O2DPG_OVERWRITE environment variable is also set to the same directory: `export ALIEN_JDL_O2DPG_OVERWRITE=${PWD}/O2DPG`.

These actions effectively override the default O2DPG setup process by using a custom repository instead of the one provided in the released software tag. This allows users to work with a specific version of O2DPG that has been customized or modified according to their needs.
