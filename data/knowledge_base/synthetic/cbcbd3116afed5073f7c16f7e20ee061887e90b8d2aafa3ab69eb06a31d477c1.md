**Question:** What is the default number of signal events (NSIGPTF) generated if not specified otherwise?

**Answer:** The default number of signal events (NSIGPTF) generated if not specified otherwise is 100.

---

**Question:** What is the default number of signal events (`NSIGPTF`) generated in the simulation, and what is the default number of background events (`NBKGPTF`)?

**Answer:** The default number of signal events (`NSIGPTF`) generated in the simulation is 100, and the default number of background events (`NBKGPTF`) is 1000.

**Question:** What specific actions are taken if the required data file `diffEvents.hepmc3` is not found in the current working directory?

**Answer:** If the required data file `diffEvents.hepmc3` is not found in the current working directory, the following action is taken:

```
echo "Error: Data file diffEvents.hepmc3 is missing" && exit 1
```

**Question:** What is the value of DVZ in the vertex settings?

**Answer:** The value of DVZ in the vertex settings is 6.00.

---

**Question:** What is the value of the vertex setting DVZ used in the simulation, and how is it defined in the document?

**Answer:** The value of the vertex setting DVZ used in the simulation is 6.00. This value is defined in the document under the vertex settings section, where DVZ is explicitly set to 6.00.

**Question:** What is the specific command used to configure the diamond width for background events in the workflow, and how does it differ from the configuration for signal events?

**Answer:** The specific command used to configure the diamond width for background events in the workflow is:

```
-Diamond.width[0]="${DVX}";Diamond.width[1]="${DVY}";Diamond.width[2]="${DVZ}"
```

This command sets the diamond width for the background events, with values of 0.01, 0.01, and 6.00 for the X, Y, and Z dimensions, respectively.

In contrast, the configuration for signal events specifies different values for the diamond width:

```
Diamond.width[0]=0.01;Diamond.width[1]=0.01;Diamond.width[2]=6.00
```

Here, the X and Y dimensions are set to 0.01, while the Z dimension is set to 6.00, which is the same as the background event configuration. Thus, the only difference is in the variable values being assigned, with background using the variables `DVX`, `DVY`, and `DVZ`, and signal using fixed values.
