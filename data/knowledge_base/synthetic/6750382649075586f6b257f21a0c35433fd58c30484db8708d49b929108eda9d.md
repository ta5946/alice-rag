**Question:** What actions are taken if the `<nEvents>` tag is not found in the XML file during the script execution?

**Answer:** If the `<nEvents>` tag is not found in the XML file, the script proceeds to extract the number of events by searching for the line containing `<nEvents>` using `grep`. Once located, it uses `awk` to print the second field, which corresponds to the number of events. This value is then stored in the variable `NEV`, and a message is printed indicating that the number of events has been set to the extracted value.
