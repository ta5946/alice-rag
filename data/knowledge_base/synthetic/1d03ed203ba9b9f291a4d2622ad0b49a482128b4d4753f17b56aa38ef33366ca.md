**Question:** What is the default time frame rate limit set for the CTF reader workflow in this script?

**Answer:** The default time frame rate limit set for the CTF reader workflow in this script is 500.

**Question:** What is the value of the `TIMEFRAME_RATE_LIMIT` variable and what is its purpose in the workflow?

**Answer:** The value of the `TIMEFRAME_RATE_LIMIT` variable is 500. Its purpose in the workflow is to limit the rate of timeframes, setting a cap at 500 timeframes per second to prevent overwhelming the system with data.

**Question:** What specific command-line options are used for the CTF reader when operating in remote mode, and how are they incorporated into the overall workflow command?

**Answer:** When operating in remote mode, the CTF reader is configured with the option `--copy-cmd no-copy`. This is incorporated into the overall workflow command through the `CTFREADEROPT` variable, which is set to include `--copy-cmd no-copy` when the mode is remote. The workflow command then includes this option by referencing the `CTFREADEROPT` variable, resulting in the full command:

```
o2-ctf-reader-workflow --copy-cmd no-copy --ctf-input list.list --onlyDet FT0,FV0,FDD --allow-missing-detectors --timeframes-rate-limit 500 --timeframes-rate-limit-ipcid 0
