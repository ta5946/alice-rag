**Question:** What is the default number of worker processes if not specified?

**Answer:** The default number of worker processes is 8 if not specified.

**Question:** What command-line options are used to configure the diamond detector width in the simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The diamond detector width is configured using the following command-line option:

`-confKey "Diamond.width[0]=0.005;Diamond.width[1]=0.005;Diamond.width[2]=6."`

This sets the width of the diamond detector in three dimensions to 0.005 in the first two dimensions and 6 in the third dimension.

**Question:** What specific sequence of command-line arguments and their values are used to configure the diamond module in the simulation workflow, and how are they integrated into the o2dpg_sim_workflow.py command?

**Answer:** The configuration for the diamond module in the simulation workflow is integrated into the o2dpg_sim_workflow.py command using the following specific sequence of command-line arguments and values:

- `-confKey "Diamond.width[0]=0.005;Diamond.width[1]=0.005;Diamond.width[2]=6."`

This configuration sets the width of the diamond module in three dimensions as follows:

- `Diamond.width[0]=0.005` - width in the first dimension (typically x-axis)
- `Diamond.width[1]=0.005` - width in the second dimension (typically y-axis)
- `Diamond.width[2]=6.` - width in the third dimension (typically z-axis)

These values are specified as a string following the `-confKey` option and are passed directly to the o2dpg_sim_workflow.py command to configure the diamond module accordingly.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `-tt aod` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command?

**Answer:** The `-tt aod` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command specifies the type of output to generate, setting it to AOD (Analysis Object Data). This tells the workflow to produce AOD files as the final output, which are optimized for analysis purposes and contain the necessary objects for further processing or analysis tasks.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--cpu-limit` option in the `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` command and what value is it set to in this specific workflow run?

**Answer:** The `--cpu-limit` option in the `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` command is used to specify the maximum number of CPU cores that the workflow is allowed to utilize. In this specific workflow run, the value set for the `--cpu-limit` option is 32.

**Question:** What specific steps would you take to modify the CPU limit for the O2DPG MC workflow runner to ensure it uses exactly 48 cores instead of 32, considering potential limitations or dependencies mentioned in the documentation?

**Answer:** To modify the CPU limit for the O2DPG MC workflow runner to ensure it uses exactly 48 cores instead of 32, you would need to adjust the `-cpu-limit` parameter in the command line. The command would be:

${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod --cpu-limit 48

Ensure that your system's resource manager or scheduler (if used) supports and correctly allocates 48 cores for the job. Check for any system-specific limitations or dependencies that might affect the core allocation. Verify that the environment variables and configurations required by the O2DPG simulation software are properly set up to recognize and utilize the increased core count.
