**Question:** What are the four main steps involved in creating and running a simulation workflow using the provided script?

**Answer:** The four main steps involved in creating and running a simulation workflow using the provided script are:
1. Creation of the simulation workflow,
2. Execution of the workflow up until the AOD stage,
3. Running QC (optional, if requested),
4. Running test analyses (optional, if requested).

**Question:** What are the default settings for memory and CPU usage if no additional settings are provided when running the simulation script?

**Answer:** The default settings for memory and CPU usage are not explicitly defined in the provided document when no additional settings are provided.

**Question:** What specific settings and flags can be used to customize the memory and CPU usage during the execution of the O2DPG_pp_minbias.sh script, and what are their effects on the simulation workflow?

**Answer:** Specific settings and flags that can be used to customize memory and CPU usage during the execution of the O2DPG_pp_minbias.sh script include:

- `MEMLIMIT=<value>`: This sets the memory limit in MB. For instance, `MEMLIMIT=12000` would allocate 12,000 MB (12GB) of memory. Adjusting this value can impact the simulation's ability to handle large data volumes and complex calculations.

- `CPULIMIT=<value>`: This flag specifies the number of CPUs to be used. For example, `CPULIMIT=12` would utilize 8 CPUs. Modifying this can affect the parallelism and speed of the simulation processing, with more CPUs potentially leading to faster execution but also higher resource consumption.

These settings are optional and can be added to the execution line to tailor the resource allocation according to the specific needs of the simulation.
