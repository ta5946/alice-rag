**Question:** What is the default value of `NITSDECTHREADS` and how does it affect the `o2-itsmft-stf-decoder-workflow`?

**Answer:** The default value of `NITSDECTHREADS` is 4. This value is used in the `o2-itsmft-stf-decoder-workflow` command where it specifies the number of threads for the "its-stf-decoder" pipeline. By setting this to 4, it ensures that the decoder processes data in parallel, potentially increasing the efficiency and speed of the decoding operation.
