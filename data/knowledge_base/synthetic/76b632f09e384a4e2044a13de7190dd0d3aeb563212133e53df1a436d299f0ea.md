**Question:** What are the requirements for the XML file used in the runJetscape command, and how does it interact with the jetscape_master.xml file?

**Answer:** The XML file used in the runJetscape command must be located within the JETSCAPE directory and should directly reference specific configuration settings required for the simulation. This master XML file interacts with the jetscape_master.xml file by inheriting its settings and configurations. The runJetscape command first specifies the custom XML file to be used for the simulation, and then it references the master configuration file located at $JETSCAPE_ROOT/config/jetscape_master.xml, which provides additional settings that are integrated into the overall simulation setup.

**Question:** What action is taken if the `<seed>` tag is found in the XML file when setting the random seed?
