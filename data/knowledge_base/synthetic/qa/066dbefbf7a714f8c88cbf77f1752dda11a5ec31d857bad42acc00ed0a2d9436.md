**Question:** What are the two main actions that can be performed using the `o2dpg-workflow-tools.py inspect` command, and how do they differ?

**Answer:** The `o2dpg-workflow-tools.py inspect` command can perform two main actions:

1. Running with `--summary` yields a brief summary of the workflow. This provides a concise overview of the workflow's structure and content without delving into detailed checks.

2. Using `--check` conducts a quick sanity check on the workflow. This action verifies that task names are unique and that all dependencies are correctly defined, ensuring the workflow is logically sound and free from immediate errors.

**Question:** What is the command used to update the number of workers in a workflow when using a relative number of workers, and what is the default output filename when merging two workflow files?

**Answer:** The command used to update the number of workers in a workflow when using a relative number of workers is:
```bash
$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg-workflow-tools.py nworkers my_workflow 9
```
When merging two workflow files, the default output filename is `workflow_merged`.

**Question:** How would you add task skeletons to an existing workflow file using the `o2dpg-workflow-tools.py` script, and what is the expected outcome?

**Answer:** To add task skeletons to an existing workflow file using the `o2dpg-workflow-tools.py` script, you would execute the following command:

```bash
$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg-workflow-tools.py add-mytasks my_workflow
```

Here, `my_workflow` refers to the existing workflow file (which should have the `.json` extension, though it can be omitted in the command and will be added automatically).

The expected outcome of this command is that task skeletons will be added to the specified workflow file. These task skeletons provide a framework or blueprint for the tasks that will be executed in the workflow, without defining their specific configurations or parameters. This allows for the setup of a structured workflow where individual tasks can later be configured and linked together.
