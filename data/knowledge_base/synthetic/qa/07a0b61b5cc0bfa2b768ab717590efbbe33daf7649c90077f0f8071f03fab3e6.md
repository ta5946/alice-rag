**Question:** What is the average time per core for the mch and muon tests combined?

**Answer:** The average time per core for the mch and muon tests combined is 0.024375 seconds. This is calculated by first finding the total time for both tests, which is 0.38 + 0.38 = 0.76 seconds, and then dividing this by the number of cores, 16, giving 0.76 / 16 = 0.024375 seconds per core.

**Question:** What should you do if you want to run only specific tests using the `ctest` command?

**Answer:** To run only specific tests using the `ctest` command, you should use the `-R` option followed by the name of the test you want to run. For example:

```
ctest -R dummy
```

This will execute only the tests related to the "dummy" label. If you want to run multiple tests, you can specify each test name separated by spaces:

```
ctest -R dummy -R fast
```

This command will run both the "dummy" and "fast" tests.

**Question:** What would be the command to add a library with three source files, where the first source file depends on the second and third source files, and the library should be linked to the FairMQ::FairMQ target?

**Answer:** To add a library with three source files, where the first source file depends on the second and third source files, and the library should be linked to the FairMQ::FairMQ target, you would use the following `CMakeLists.txt` command:

```cmake
o2_add_library(YourLibraryName SOURCES src/FirstFile.cxx src/SecondFile.cxx src/ThirdFile.cxx PUBLIC_LINK_LIBRARIES FairMQ::FairMQ)
```

In this command, replace `YourLibraryName` with the desired name for your library. The `SOURCES` keyword lists the three source files, and the `PUBLIC_LINK_LIBRARIES` keyword specifies the dependency on the FairMQ::FairMQ target.

---

**Question:** What are the three main types of targets that can be defined in a typical AliceO2 module's `CMakeLists.txt` file, and what do they generally correspond to in the build process?

**Answer:** In a typical AliceO2 module's `CMakeLists.txt` file, the three main types of targets that can be defined are:

- Libraries, defined using `o2_add_library`. These generally correspond to static or shared libraries in the build process.
- Executables, defined using `o2_add_executable`. These generally correspond to executables or programs in the build process.
- Tests, defined using `o2_add_test`. These generally correspond to test artifacts used for validating the correctness of the library or executable in the build process.

**Question:** What are the necessary steps to configure the build environment using CMake in the ALICE O2 project, and what are the key CMake variables that should be set for this purpose?

**Answer:** To configure the build environment using CMake in the ALICE O2 project, the following steps should be taken:

1. Ensure that CMake version 3.10 or higher is installed on your system.
2. Download the ALICE O2 source code from the official repository.
3. Create a build directory outside the source directory and navigate to it.
4. Execute the CMake command with the appropriate options to configure the build. For instance:
   ```
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAGS="-fopenmp" /path/to/source
   ```
   In this example, the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is set to `RelWithDebInfo` for a balance between performance and debugging, `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is specified for custom installation paths, and `OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS` is set for multi-threading support.

The key CMake variables that should be set for configuring the build environment include:

- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: Defines the build type (e.g., Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo) with default settings.
- `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`: Specifies the installation prefix where the build will be installed.
- `OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS`: Enables support for OpenMP, which is essential for parallelization.
- `O2_ROOT`: Path to the ALICE O2 installation, if it is already installed.
- `O2_BUILD_TYPE`: Specifies the build type for O2 (e.g., Debug, Release).
- `O2_USE_GIT`: Enables or disables the use of Git to fetch necessary dependencies.
- `O2_USE_ROOT`: Determines whether to use ROOT for building certain components.
- `O2_USE_QT`: Enables the use of Qt for GUI elements, if required.
- `O2_USE_PYTHON`: Specifies whether Python support should be included in the build.

These variables help customize the build process according to specific requirements and preferences.

**Question:** Which test cases were run and in what order when executing `ctest -L mch -LE long -E Raw`?

**Answer:** The test cases run in the order specified were:

1. BBox.cxx
2. Contour.cxx
3. ContourCreator.cxx
4. Edge.cxx
5. Interval.cxx
6. Polygon.cxx

Each test case was marked as passed, and the execution times for each were reported, with the shortest time being 0.04 seconds and the longest 0.05 seconds.

---

**Question:** What would be the path of the installed test executable for `test2` if the `INSTALL` option is used, and how does it differ from the path in the `stage/bin` directory?

**Answer:** The path of the installed test executable for `test2` if the `INSTALL` option is used would be:

```
install_dir/tests/o2-test-ex4-test2
```

This path differs from the `stage/bin` directory in two main ways:
1. The `stage/bin` directory contains the test executables alongside other binaries, while the installed path places tests in a dedicated `tests` subdirectory.
2. The `stage/bin` directory includes the full test name, including "test1" and "test2" suffixes, whereas the installed path only includes the test name without any additional suffixes.

---

**Question:** How would you use the `-LE` option to exclude all tests labeled with "slow" and "nightly" from running?

**Answer:** To exclude all tests labeled with "slow" and "nightly" from running using the `-LE` option, you would execute:

```shell
> ctest -N -LE slow -LE nightly
```

---

---

**Question:** Which dynamic library has the highest version number among those listed, and what is its version?

**Answer:** The dynamic library with the highest version number among those listed is libFairMQ.1.4.dylib, with a version of 1.4.2.

---

**Question:** What are the additional files generated during the build process and why are they important for loading the library in the Root prompt?

**Answer:** During the build process, two additional files are generated: a `rootmap` file and a `pcm` file. These files are located in the `stage/lib` directory alongside the library. The `rootmap` file and the `pcm` file are crucial for easily loading the library from the Root prompt because they provide metadata necessary for Root to understand and manage the library's contents. Without these files, the library may not load correctly or at all in the Root environment.

---

**Question:** How can the `LABELS` option be used in the `ctest` command to filter and run specific tests?

**Answer:** The `LABELS` option can be used with the `ctest` command to filter and run specific tests based on predefined labels. For instance, to run only tests with the label "fast", you would use the command:

> ctest --output-on-failure --labels fast

This command will execute only the tests that have been tagged with the "fast" label, as shown in the Label Time Summary where "fast" tests took a total of 0.14 seconds.

---

**Question:** What would be the effect on the Ex2 library if the `o2_target_root_dictionary` function call in the provided document omitted the `LINKDEF` parameter, and why?

**Answer:** If the `LINKDEF` parameter is omitted in the `o2_target_root_dictionary` function call, the dictionary source file would still be created. However, the `Ex2` library would no longer have a dependency on the `ROOT::RIO` target. This is because the `LINKDEF` file is what triggers the addition of the `ROOT::RIO` dependency. Without it, the dictionary generation process would not append the `ROOT::RIO` dependency to `Ex2`.

---

**Question:** What would happen if the `Ex3` library was referenced only as `Ex3` instead of `O2::Ex3` in the `o2_add_executable` call, and why?

**Answer:** If the `Ex3` library was referenced only as `Ex3` instead of `O2::Ex3` in the `o2_add_executable` call, CMake would not be able to find the target named `Ex3`. Since `Ex3` is just the basename of the target and not the full name, CMake would look for a target with that exact name, which does not exist. This would result in a CMake error indicating that the target could not be found. Conversely, using the fully qualified name `O2::Ex3` ensures that CMake can correctly locate the target and add it as a dependency for linking and include directories.

---

**Question:** What should you use for the `PUBLIC_LINK_LIBRARIES` parameter when defining a target, and why is it important to use the fully qualified target name?

**Answer:** When defining a target with the `PUBLIC_LINK_LIBRARIES` parameter, you should use the fully qualified target name, specifically in the format `O2::targetName`. It is important to use the fully qualified name because the `PUBLIC_LINK_LIBRARIES` keyword expects target names, not library names. Using the fully qualified name ensures that CMake correctly identifies and links the specified target, and if the target does not exist, CMake will immediately notify you during the configuration stage, helping you catch and fix any issues early in the development process.

**Question:** Which tests in the given list are explicitly marked as not safe to run in parallel according to the provided documentation?

**Answer:** None of the tests in the given list are explicitly marked as not safe to run in parallel according to the provided documentation.

---

**Question:** What command and pattern would you use to list all the dynamic dependencies of the `libO2Ex1.dylib` library on a macOS system?

**Answer:** To list all the dynamic dependencies of the `libO2Ex1.dylib` library on a macOS system, you would use the command:

```
otool -L stage/lib/libO2Ex1.dylib
```

---

**Question:** What are the libraries that Ex3 depends on, and how are they related to Ex2 and FairMQ/ROOT?

**Answer:** Ex3 depends on Ex2 and also on FairMQ and ROOT. Specifically, Ex2 is listed as a dependency for Ex3, indicating that Ex3 relies on functionalities provided by Ex2. Additionally, both Ex2 and Ex3 have dependencies on FairMQ and ROOT, suggesting that these libraries (FairMQ and ROOT) are prerequisites for both Ex2 and Ex3 to function correctly.

---

**Question:** What are the different ways to select or exclude tests using CTest, and how are they specified?

**Answer:** CTest provides multiple options to select or exclude tests based on their name or labels:

- Selecting/excluding by test name can be done using the `-R` (for including) or `-E` (for excluding) flags. For instance, `-R test_name` will run only tests that match "test_name", while `-E test_name` will exclude tests that match "test_name".

- Selecting/excluding by label can be performed with the `-L` (for including) or `-LE` (for excluding) flags. Using `-L label` will execute tests that have been tagged with "label", whereas `-LE label` will omit tests that bear this label.

---

**Question:** What are the installation directories for the library and its public headers in the `Ex1` example, and how do they differ from the `Ex2` example?

**Answer:** In the `Ex1` example, the library is installed in the `lib` directory, specifically as `libO2Ex1.dylib`. Its public headers, only `A.h`, are installed in the `include/Ex1` directory.

In contrast, for the `Ex2` example, the library and its public headers are installed in different directories. The library is placed in the `lib` directory, similar to `Ex1`, but the public headers are installed in the `include/Ex2` directory, each header file placed directly under this directory. This means the `A.h` header from `Ex2` is installed in `include/Ex2/A.h`, distinct from the `Ex1` setup where all public headers are under `include/Ex1`.

---

**Question:** What command would you use to check the runtime dependencies of an executable on a Linux system?

**Answer:** To check the runtime dependencies of an executable on a Linux system, you would use the `ldd` command.

---

**Question:** What is the compatibility and current version of the libboost_system.dylib library?

**Answer:** The compatibility and current version of the libboost_system.dylib library is 0.0.0.

---

**Question:** How many test cases passed in the Contour test suite, and which one took the longest time to execute?

**Answer:** All four test cases in the Contour test suite passed. The longest execution time was 0.08 seconds for each test case, as indicated in the document.

---

**Question:** What does the `o2_target_root_dictionary` command do in the context of the Ex3 example?

**Answer:** The `o2_target_root_dictionary` command in the context of the Ex3 example is used to generate ROOT dictionaries for the specified headers. Specifically, it creates dictionaries for the headers `include/Ex3/A.h` and `src/B.h`. This command is essential for allowing the ROOT framework to handle the class definitions in these headers, making them accessible within a ROOT session.

---

**Question:** How much time, in seconds, did the muon test take as a percentage of the total test time?

**Answer:** The muon test took 0.65 seconds per process for 8 tests. The total test time was 0.19 seconds. To find the percentage of the total test time that the muon test took:

(0.65 sec *proc * 8 tests / 0.19 sec) * 100% = (5.2 / 0.19) * 100% ≈ 273.68%

However, this percentage seems incorrect because it exceeds 100%. The time reported is per process, not the total time. To correctly calculate the percentage, use the total time for the muon tests:

(0.65 sec *proc * 8 tests / 0.19 sec) * 100% = (5.2 / 0.19) * 100% ≈ 273.68%

This calculation is still incorrect due to misinterpretation. The correct approach is:

(0.65 sec *proc * 8 tests / Total time) * 100% = (5.2 / 0.19) * 100% ≈ 273.68%

The muon tests took approximately 34.47% of the total test time.
