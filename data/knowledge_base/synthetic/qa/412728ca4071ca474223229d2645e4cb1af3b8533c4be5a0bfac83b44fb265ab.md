**Question:** What is the sequence of sorting for PRs when using the `o2dpg_make_github_pr_report.py` tool, and which timestamp is used for each state?

**Answer:** The sequence of sorting for PRs when using the `o2dpg_make_github_pr_report.py` tool is as follows:

1. First, PRs are sorted by their state, starting with:
   - Closed and Merged
   - Just Closed
   - Open

2. Within each state category, PRs are grouped by the assigned labels.

3. For the `closed` and `merged` states, the sorting is based on the `merged_at` timestamp.

4. For the `closed` but not `merged` state, the sorting is based on the `updated_at` timestamp.

5. For the `open` state, the sorting is based on the `updated_at` timestamp.
