**Question:** What is the minimum number of arguments required when running the script `run_DeTrHeInjected.sh`, and what is the expected format of the first argument?

**Answer:** The minimum number of arguments required when running the script `run_DeTrHeInjected.sh` is one. The first argument should be the name of the CFGINIFILE to be used, which in the provided example is expected to be in the format `${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/config/PWGLF/ini/GeneratorLFDeTrHe_pp.ini`.

**Question:** What is the default value for the number of signal events (NSIGEVENTS) and how does changing this value affect the simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The default value for the number of signal events (NSIGEVENTS) is 1. Changing this value modifies the number of signal events generated in the simulation, directly impacting the simulation workflow by altering the event dataset size and potentially affecting the computational resources and time required for the simulation.

**Question:** What happens if the script is executed without any arguments?

**Answer:** If the script is executed without any arguments, it will print the usage message "Usage: $0 <CFGINIFILE>" and exit with status 1.

**Question:** What is the command used to create the simulation workflow, and what are the key parameters involved in this command?

**Answer:** The command used to create the simulation workflow is:

${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM ${ENERGY} -col ${SYSTEM} -gen external -j ${NWORKERS} -ns ${NSIGEVENTS} -tf ${NTIMEFRAMES} -interactionRate ${INTRATE} -confKey "Diamond.width[2]=6." -e ${SIMENGINE} ${SEED} -mod "${MODULES}" -ini ${CFGINIFILE}

The key parameters involved in this command are:

- -eCM ${ENERGY}: specifying the collision energy in CM frame
- -col ${SYSTEM}: defining the system (e.g., pp, PbPb)
- -gen external: indicating the event generator to be used
- -j ${NWORKERS}: the number of worker threads
- -ns ${NSIGEVENTS}: the number of signal events
- -tf ${NTIMEFRAMES}: the number of time frames
- -interactionRate ${INTRATE}: the interaction rate
- -confKey "Diamond.width[2]=6.": a configuration key to modify the simulation settings
- -e ${SIMENGINE}: specifying the simulation engine
- ${SEED}: the seed for random number generation
- -mod "${MODULES}": the list of modules to be used in the simulation
- -ini ${CFGINIFILE}: the configuration file for the simulation
