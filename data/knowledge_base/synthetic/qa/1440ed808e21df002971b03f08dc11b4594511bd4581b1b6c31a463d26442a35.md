**Question:** What command is used to extract and save performance metrics for each workflow in JSON format?

**Answer:** The command used to extract and save performance metrics for each workflow in JSON format is:

```bash
cat performanceMetrics.json | jq '.'${strippedWorkflow}'' > ${strippedWorkflow}_metrics.json
```

This command processes each workflow found in `performanceMetrics.json`, extracts the relevant section, and saves it as a separate JSON file named after the workflow.

**Question:** What is the significance of the asterisks (*) and dashes (-) in the echoed string, and how might they be interpreted in the context of the simulation setup?

**Answer:** The asterisks (*) and dashes (-) in the echoed string serve as visual separators to demarcate the start and end of a critical section within the simulation setup documentation. Specifically, the asterisks (*) at the beginning and the dashes (-) at the end create a clear boundary, signifying that the enclosed text is a header or a section title indicating the absence of special settings. This format helps in quickly identifying the nature of the content and distinguishing it from other parts of the setup script, enhancing readability and organization.

**Question:** What will be the value of the `MODE` variable if the script is run with an input file that has a ".root" extension and there is no `ALIEN_JDL_INPUTFILELIMIT` environment variable set?

**Answer:** The value of the `MODE` variable will be "LOCAL".

---

**Question:** What is the default value of `SHMSIZE` if neither the `ALIEN_JDL_SHMSIZE` nor the `SHMSIZE` environment variable is set?

**Answer:** The default value of `SHMSIZE` if neither the `ALIEN_JDL_SHMSIZE` nor the `SHMSIZE` environment variable is set is `16 GiB` or `16 * 2^30 bytes`.

---

**Question:** What are the values of the `SHMSIZE` and `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variables when GPUs are not enabled?

**Answer:** The values of the `SHMSIZE` and `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variables when GPUs are not enabled are `SHMSIZE=16000000000` and `OMP_NUM_THREADS=5`.

---

**Question:** What action is taken if the `DPL_WORKFLOW_FROM_OUTSIDE` environment variable is not set?

**Answer:** If the `DPL_WORKFLOW_FROM_OUTSIDE` environment variable is not set, the script will copy `dpl-workflow.sh` from the O2 root directory to the current directory.

---

**Question:** What will happen if any of the required environment variables (RUNNUMBER, PERIOD, PASS, or BEAMTYPE) are not set when the script is executed?

**Answer:** If any of the required environment variables (RUNNUMBER, PERIOD, PASS, or BEAMTYPE) are not set when the script is executed, the script will output an error message stating that the environment variables need to be checked, and then it will exit with a status code of 3.

**Question:** What steps are taken if a `commonInput.tgz` file is found in the current directory during the echo processing run?

**Answer:** If a `commonInput.tgz` file is found in the current directory during the echo processing run, the following steps are taken:

1. The `commonInput.tgz` file is extracted using `tar -xzvf commonInput.tgz`.
2. The script `selectSettings.sh` is located. If a local `selectSettings.sh` exists, it is used instead of the one from the common archive.
3. The `selectSettings.sh` script is sourced to apply the necessary settings.

**Question:** What actions are taken if the "setenv_extra.sh" file does not exist in the current directory but exists in the O2DPG_ROOT path?

**Answer:** If the "setenv_extra.sh" file does not exist in the current directory but is found in the O2DPG_ROOT path, the following actions are taken:

1. A symbolic link (ln -s) is created to point to the "setenv_extra.sh" file located at $O2DPG_ROOT/DATA/production/configurations/$ALIEN_JDL_LPMANCHORYEAR/extractCalib/setenv_extra.sh.
2. The script then sources the "setenv_extra.sh" file, passing it the $RUNNUMBER and $BEAMTYPE variables.

**Question:** What is the order of precedence for setting the `PERIOD` variable in the script?

**Answer:** The order of precedence for setting the `PERIOD` variable in the script is as follows:

1. The `-p` or `--period` command line argument.
2. The environment variable `ALIEN_JDL_LPMPRODUCTIONTAG`.
3. If `ALIEN_JDL_LPMPRODUCTIONTAG` is set, the `O2DPGPATH` is also set to either the value of `PERIOD` or the value of `ALIEN_JDL_O2DPGPATH` if that environment variable is defined.
