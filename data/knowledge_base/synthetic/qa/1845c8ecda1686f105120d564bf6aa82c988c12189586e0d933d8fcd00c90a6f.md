**Question:** What actions are taken for a task in the `draw_graph` function if Graphviz is not installed?

**Answer:** If Graphviz is not installed, the function `draw_graph` prints 'graphviz not installed, cannot draw workflow' and returns without attempting to draw the workflow.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `write_json_report` function call when the `args.output` condition is met?

**Answer:** The `write_json_report` function call, when the `args.output` condition is met, serves to save the report data in JSON format to the specified output file, facilitating the storage and sharing of the generated report information in a structured and easily readable manner.

**Question:** How many nodes are added to the 'CCDB' subgraph if there are 5 files matching the CCDB pattern in the `allfiles` set?

**Answer:** 5

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `nametoindex` dictionary in this code snippet?

**Answer:** The `nametoindex` dictionary serves to map names of files and tasks to unique numerical indices. This allows for easy reference and generation of nodes in the graph, where each file and task is assigned a specific identifier for accurate representation within the graph structure.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--file-filters` argument and what is its default value?

**Answer:** The `--file-filters` argument allows specifying filters (regular expressions) to select files. Its default value is set to `['.*']`, which corresponds to selecting all files.

---

**Question:** What additional tool is required for generating the graphviz visualization, and what happens if it is not available?

**Answer:** The additional tool required for generating the graphviz visualization is graphviz. If graphviz is not available, the script will not produce the graphviz visualization of file and task dependencies.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `file_exclude_filter` regular expression in the given code snippet?

**Answer:** The `file_exclude_filter` regular expression is used to exclude certain file names from processing. It matches against file names that end with `.log`, contain `ccdb/log`, or end with `dpl-config.json`. If a file name matches any of these patterns, it is excluded from further processing.

**Question:** What structures are filled when parsing the monitor file, and what is the purpose of these structures?

**Answer:** When parsing the monitor file, the following structures are filled:

- `task_reads`: A dictionary where each key is a task name and the value is a set of files that the task reads.
- `task_writes`: A dictionary where each key is a task name and the value is a set of files that the task writes.
- `file_written_task`: A dictionary where each key is a file name and the value is a set of task names that write to that file.
- `file_consumed_task`: A dictionary where each key is a file name and the value is a set of task names that read from that file.

The purpose of these structures is to map files to processes and operations, allowing for the tracking of which tasks read from or write to which files.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `write_json_report` function and what information does it generate?

**Answer:** The `write_json_report` function generates a JSON report of file dependencies. It creates two main sections: 

1. For each file in the set of all filenames (combining keys from `file_written_task` and `file_consumed_task`), it records which tasks wrote to the file and which tasks read from the file.
2. For each task, it records which files the task wrote to and which files the task read from.

This report provides a clear overview of the file dependencies and task-to-file relationships in the simulation.
