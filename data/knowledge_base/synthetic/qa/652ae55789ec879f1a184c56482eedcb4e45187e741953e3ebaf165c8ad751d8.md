**Question:** What specific particle is used for selective transport in this simulation, and how is it configured?

**Answer:** The specific particle used for selective transport in this simulation is the pion (PDG code 321). This is configured through the following settings in the sim.ini file:
```
[Stack]
transportPrimary=external
transportPrimaryFileName=transportPDG.macro
transportPrimaryFuncName=transportPDG(321)
transportPrimaryInvert=false
```

**Question:** What is the effect of setting `transportPrimaryInvert` to true, and how does it interact with the definition provided by `transportPrimary`?

**Answer:** Setting `transportPrimaryInvert` to true will inhibit the transport of particles for which the selection defined by `transportPrimary` is true. This means that if `transportPrimary` selects a certain set of particles for transport, `transportPrimaryInvert` will ensure that these particles are not transported, effectively blocking their propagation through the simulation.
