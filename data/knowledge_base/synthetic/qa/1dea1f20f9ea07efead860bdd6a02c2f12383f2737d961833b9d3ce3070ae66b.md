**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--prob-threshold 1e-5` argument in the `o2-calibration-mft-calib-workflow` command?

**Answer:** The `--prob-threshold 1e-5` argument in the `o2-calibration-mft-calib-workflow` command is used to set a probability threshold. This threshold is likely employed to filter or prioritize certain data points or events that are deemed significant based on their probability, with events having a probability lower than 1e-5 being considered for calibration purposes. This helps in focusing on more reliable or relevant data for noise map calibration in the MFT (Midpoint Fiber Tracker) system.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `PROXY_INSPEC` variable in the given script?

**Answer:** The `PROXY_INSPEC` variable in the given script is used to define the input specifications for data handling. Specifically, it instructs the system on how to retrieve and process data from the MFT (Multipurpose Tracker) subsystem, indicating that it should look for DIGITS data from the A channel and DIGITSROF data from the B channel.

**Question:** What will happen if the WORKFLOWMODE variable is set to "print" and there is a WORKFLOW variable containing multiple commands separated by "| "?

**Answer:** If the WORKFLOWMODE variable is set to "print" and the WORKFLOW variable contains multiple commands separated by "| ", the script will print the workflow command in a formatted manner, with each command on a new line. Specifically, it will execute the following steps:

1. The script will print "Workflow command:".
2. It will then use the `sed` command to replace each occurrence of "| " with "| " followed by a newline character, effectively breaking each command into its own line.
3. The modified workflow command will be printed to the console, with each command on a separate line.
