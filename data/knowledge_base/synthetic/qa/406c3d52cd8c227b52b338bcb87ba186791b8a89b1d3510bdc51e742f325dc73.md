**Question:** What is the purpose of the env-variables mentioned in the documentation, and how might they be relevant to configuring the full-system-test in the O2 simulation?

**Answer:** The env-variables mentioned in the documentation serve as configuration parameters for the full-system-test in the O2 simulation. They allow users to customize and control various aspects of the simulation environment, such as resource allocation, test scenarios, and data handling. By setting these variables, users can tailor the full-system-test to their specific needs, ensuring that the simulation accurately reflects the conditions and requirements of their experimental setup. This flexibility is crucial for validating the O2 software stack under diverse and realistic conditions, making the env-variables an essential component in configuring the full-system-test.
