**Question:** What is the purpose of the `-procBkg` and `-colBkg` options in the simulation workflow command, and what background process is being specified?

**Answer:** The `-procBkg` and `-colBkg` options in the simulation workflow command are used to specify the background process to be included in the simulation. Specifically, `-procBkg "inel"` sets the background process to inelastic interactions, while `-colBkg $SYSTEM` indicates that the background events should be generated for the specified collision system. This allows for the simulation to include both signal and background events, with the background events generated using inelastic processes in the specified collision system.

**Question:** What is the default number of time frames for the simulation if not specified otherwise?

**Answer:** The default number of time frames for the simulation, if not specified otherwise, is 1.
