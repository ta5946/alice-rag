**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in the script, and how does it transform the `WORKFLOW` variable?

**Answer:** The `sed` command in the script is used to transform the `WORKFLOW` variable, which contains a pipeline of commands, into a more readable format. Specifically, it replaces spaces followed by "||" with a newline, effectively breaking down the pipeline into multiple lines. This transformation makes the workflow command easier to read and understand when the `WORKFLOWMODE` variable is set to "print".
