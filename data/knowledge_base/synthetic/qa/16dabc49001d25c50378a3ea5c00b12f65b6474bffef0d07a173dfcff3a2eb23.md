**Question:** What actions are taken if the QualityControl or O2Physics packages are not loaded when `DOQC` or `DOANALYSIS` are set?

**Answer:** If `DOQC` or `DOANALYSIS` are set but the QualityControl or O2Physics packages are not loaded, an error message is printed and the script exits with a status of 1. Specifically, if `DOQC` is set and QualityControl is not loaded, an error message "Error: This needs QualityControl loaded" is displayed. Similarly, if `DOANALYSIS` is set and O2Physics is not loaded, the error message "Error: This needs O2Physics loaded" is shown.

**Question:** What is the value of the variable `RET` based on the conditions and operations provided in the script?

**Answer:** The value of the variable `RET` is determined by the sum of `RETMC`, `RETQC`, and `RETANA`. Specifically, `RET` is calculated as:

```
RET=$((${RETMC} + ${RETQC} + ${RETANA}))
```

This sum reflects the aggregated return values from running the Monte Carlo (MC), Quality Control (QC), and Analysis workflows, with each potentially contributing its own success or failure status to the overall result.
