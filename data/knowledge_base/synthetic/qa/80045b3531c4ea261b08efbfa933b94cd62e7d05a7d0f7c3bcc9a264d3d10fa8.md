**Question:** What is the default value of the `SIMENGINE` variable if it is not set when the script is executed?

**Answer:** The default value of the `SIMENGINE` variable is TGeant4 if it is not set when the script is executed.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `O2_SIM_WORKFLOW` and `O2_SIM_WORKFLOW_RUNNER` variables, and what do they execute in the context of the workflow?

**Answer:** The `O2_SIM_WORKFLOW` and `O2_SIM_WORKFLOW_RUNNER` variables are used to specify the scripts that will be executed in the context of the workflow. Specifically, `O2_SIM_WORKFLOW` points to the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script, which is responsible for setting up and configuring the simulation workflow. This script takes parameters like collision energy, system, number of workers, number of signal events, time frames, interaction rate, configuration key, seed, simulation engine, and configuration file to create the workflow. 

`O2_SIM_WORKFLOW_RUNNER` is set to point to `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`, which is used to run the workflow that was previously created. It reads from `workflow.json` and uses the `--cpu-limit` option to restrict the number of CPU workers to the value of the `NWORKERS` variable. This runner script is tasked with executing the simulation according to the defined workflow and constraints.
