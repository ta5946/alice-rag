**Question:** What additional command-line options can be passed to the script, and how are they used?

**Answer:** Additional command-line options that can be passed to the script include:

- `-m,--more CONFIG`: To specify more configurations, using the value provided for $more.
- `-n,--nevents EVENTS`: To define the number of events, utilizing the value of $nev.
- `-i,--input INPUT`: To set options file fed to EPOS4, with $optns holding the default value.
- `-j,--jobs JOBS`: To indicate the number of jobs, with $JOBS as the default.
- `-h,--help`: To print the help instructions.
- `-e,--ecm ENERGY`: To specify the Center-of-Mass energy.
- `-t,--tf TF`: To define the timeframes, using $TF as the default.
- `--hq`: To enable EPOS4HQ.
- `--`: Any remaining command-line arguments will be passed directly to o2-sim.

Each option serves to customize the behavior or input parameters of the script, and any arguments following `--` are directly forwarded to o2-sim for further processing.

**Question:** What happens if the user does not provide any command-line arguments when running the script?

**Answer:** If the user does not provide any command-line arguments when running the script, the message "Running with default values" is displayed.

**Question:** What version of EPOS4 is required to use this script, and what is the default HepMC version for this version?

**Answer:** The script requires EPOS4 version starting from 4.0.0 or later. For EPOS4 version 4.0.0, the default HepMC version is 2. For any other version of EPOS4, the default HepMC version is 3.

**Question:** What action is taken if the "nfull" parameter is not found in the options file when the NEV variable is not set to -1?

**Answer:** If the "nfull" parameter is not found in the options file and the NEV variable is not set to -1, the script appends "set nfull $NEV" to the options file.

**Question:** What are the effects of using `--stdout-on-failure` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py script and how does it impact the workflow execution?

**Answer:** Using the `--stdout-on-failure` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py script directs the standard output to the console in case the workflow encounters an error. This setting ensures that any output generated during the execution of the script is displayed on the terminal if the workflow fails. As a result, users can immediately see the output when something goes wrong, which can help in identifying and resolving issues more quickly. This feature enhances the debugging process by providing real-time information about the workflow's status and any errors that occur, making it easier to diagnose and fix problems without the need to manually check logs or files.

**Question:** What actions are taken if the HQ mode is enabled, and what happens if it is disabled, specifically regarding the modification of the `ihq` setting in the options file?

**Answer:** If the HQ mode is enabled, the `ihq` setting in the options file is set to 1. If the `ihq` line already exists, it is replaced with `set ihq 1`. If it does not exist, a new line `set ihq 1` is appended to the options file. If the HQ mode is disabled, the `ihq` setting in the options file is set to 0. Similarly, if the `ihq` line exists, it is replaced with `set ihq 0`; if it does not exist, a new line `set ihq 0` is added to the options file.

**Question:** What actions are taken if the ECM energy is not explicitly set in the script?

**Answer:** If the ECM energy is not explicitly set in the script, the following actions are taken:

1. The script checks the optns.optns file for an existing entry related to ECM.
2. If "ecms" is found in the file, the script updates the ECM value by modifying the existing "ecms" line to set it to the current value.
3. If "ecms" is not found in the file, the script appends a new line to the file setting the ECM value.
4. If "ecms" is found but the ECM value is not set (i.e., the third column after "ecms" is empty), the script reports an error and exits with code 6.
5. If "ecms" is not found in the file, the script reports an error indicating that the ECM has not been set in EPOS4 and exits with code 6.
