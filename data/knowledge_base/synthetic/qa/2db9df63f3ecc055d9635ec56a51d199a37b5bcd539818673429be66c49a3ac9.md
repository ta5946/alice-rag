**Question:** What will happen if the `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "print" and the `PRINT_WORKFLOW` variable is also set to "1"?

**Answer:** If the `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "print" and the `PRINT_WORKFLOW` variable is also set to "1", the workflow command will be printed. Specifically, the command will be echoed with proper formatting, and if the `WORKFLOWMODE` is "dds", the output will be sent to standard error.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `add_W` function calls in the workflow and what are the specific parameters used for the `o2-dpl-raw-proxy` and `o2-tpc-raw-to-digits-workflow` binaries?

**Answer:** The `add_W` function calls in the workflow are used to define and add specific workflows to the overall DPL (Detector Primitive Layer) configuration, specifying the binary to be used, command line options, and configuration key values for each step.

For the `o2-dpl-raw-proxy` binary:
- `--dataspec` is set to "$PROXY_INSPEC", which specifies the input data to be processed, in this case, all RAWDATA from TPC.
- `--inject-missing-data` is used to fill in missing data during the processing.
- `--readout-proxy` specifies the configuration for the readout proxy, including its address and transport method.

For the `o2-tpc-raw-to-digits-workflow` binary:
- `--input-spec` is set to "$PROXY_INSPEC", indicating the input data for this workflow.
- `--remove-duplicates` is used to eliminate duplicate entries in the data.
