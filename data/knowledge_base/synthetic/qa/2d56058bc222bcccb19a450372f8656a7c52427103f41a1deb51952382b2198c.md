**Question:** What is the default value of the NEV variable if no argument is provided?

**Answer:** The default value of the NEV variable if no argument is provided is -1.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--field ccdb` option in the command and how does it interact with the simulation?

**Answer:** The `--field ccdb` option in the command specifies the use of the CCDB (Common Control Database) for field information in the simulation. This database contains calibrated and validated field maps that are crucial for the accurate simulation of particle trajectories in the magnetic field environment of the ALICE detector. By enabling this option, the simulation retrieves the necessary field maps from the CCDB, ensuring that the magnetic field conditions are correctly applied to the generated particles. This interaction ensures that the simulation environment closely mirrors the real-world conditions in which the detector operates, thereby enhancing the validity and precision of the generated events.

**Question:** What actions are taken if the number of events is not explicitly set via the command-line option `-n` or `--nevents`?

**Answer:** If the number of events is not explicitly set via the command-line option `-n` or `--nevents`, the script defaults to setting the number of events to 10. Specifically, the script checks if the variable `NEV` is not equal to -1. If this condition is not met, it prints "Number of events not set, defaulting to 10..." and then sets `NEV` to 10.
