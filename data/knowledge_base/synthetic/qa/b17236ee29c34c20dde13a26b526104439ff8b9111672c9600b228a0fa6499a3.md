**Question:** What modules are skipped in the simulation workflow, and how is the background simulation configured?

**Answer:** In the simulation workflow, the ZDC module is skipped as indicated by the command line option `--skipModules ZDC`.

The background simulation is configured using `pythia8` and the process type is set to `heavy_ion`. Specifically, the background events are generated for the PbPb collision system with the command line options `-genBkg pythia8 -procBkg "heavy_ion" -colBkg PbPb`. Additionally, the `--embedding` option is used for embedding the simulated events into real data.
