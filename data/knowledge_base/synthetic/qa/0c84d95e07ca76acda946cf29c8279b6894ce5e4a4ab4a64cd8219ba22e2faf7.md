**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--embedIntoFile` option in the o2-sim command, and how does it affect the output?

**Answer:** The `--embedIntoFile` option in the o2-sim command is used to embed the signal events generated into an existing background file. Specifically, it integrates the signal events into the specified background file, `bkg_Kine.root` in this case. This operation does not create a new file but modifies the existing one by appending the generated signal events to it. As a result, the output file `bkg_Kine.root` will contain both the original background events and the newly embedded signal events, combining them into a single dataset that can be used for further analysis.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--embedIntoFile` option in the signal generation configuration?

**Answer:** The `--embedIntoFile` option in the signal generation configuration is used to embed the generated signal events into an existing background file. This allows the signal to be seamlessly integrated with the previously created background events, ensuring a realistic simulation environment.
