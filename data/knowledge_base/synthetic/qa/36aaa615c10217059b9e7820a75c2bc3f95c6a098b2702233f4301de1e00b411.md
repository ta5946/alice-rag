**Question:** What is the purpose of the `GPU_proc.debugLevel` parameter in the `o2_gpu_reco_workflow` configuration?

**Answer:** The `GPU_proc.debugLevel` parameter in the `o2_gpu_reco_workflow` configuration is used to control the verbosity of debug information generated by the GPU processing workflow. Setting `GPU_proc.debugLevel=1` enables debug output, which can be useful for troubleshooting and understanding the workflow's behavior during reconstruction tasks.

**Question:** What is the effect of the `WORKFLOWMODE` environment variable when set to "print" on the file extension of the output generated by `gen_topo.sh`?

**Answer:** When the `WORKFLOWMODE` environment variable is set to "print", the file extension of the output generated by `gen_topo.sh` is set to "sh" instead of the default "xml".

**Question:** What would be the effect of changing the `DDMODE` variable from "processing" to "processing-disk" in the script?

**Answer:** Changing the `DDMODE` variable from "processing" to "processing-disk" would alter the DataDistribution mode. In "processing-disk" mode, data will be stored both in the processing mode and on disk. This provides a balance between retaining data for processing and ensuring that it is not lost, making it suitable for scenarios where data integrity and accessibility are important.
