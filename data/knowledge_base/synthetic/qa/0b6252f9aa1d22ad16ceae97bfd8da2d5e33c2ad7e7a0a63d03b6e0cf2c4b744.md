**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--remove-duplicates` option in the `o2-tpc-raw-to-digits-workflow`?

**Answer:** The `--remove-duplicates` option in the `o2-tpc-raw-to-digits-workflow` is used to eliminate duplicate raw data entries, ensuring that only unique data points are processed into digits, which can help in reducing noise and improving the accuracy of the digitization process.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `PROXY_INSPEC` and `CALIB_INSPEC` variables in the script, and how are they used?

**Answer:** The `PROXY_INSPEC` and `CALIB_INSPEC` variables in the script are both set to "A:TPC/RAWDATA;dd:FLP/DISTSUBTIMEFRAME/0". These variables specify the input specifications for proxy and calibration data, respectively, for the TPC (Time Projection Chamber) component in the O2 framework.

These input specifications are used to define how the data is accessed and formatted. In this case, the specifications indicate that the raw data from the TPC should be accessed, and it is expected to be in the form of distributed subtimeframes (DD:FLP/DISTSUBTIMEFRAME/0).

The values assigned to these variables are consistent, suggesting that both proxy and calibration processes are expected to use the same raw data from the TPC. This setup ensures that the necessary raw data is correctly identified and processed by the proxy and calibration components in the workflow.
