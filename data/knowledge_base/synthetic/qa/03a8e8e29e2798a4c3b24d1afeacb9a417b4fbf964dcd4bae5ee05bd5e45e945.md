**Question:** What is the value of the `RNDSIG` variable and how is it determined?

**Answer:** The value of the `RNDSIG` variable is determined by taking the remainder of the division of the output of `$RANDOM` by 100. `$RANDOM` generates a random integer, and the modulus operation ensures `RNDSIG` will be a number between 0 and 99, inclusive.
