**Question:** What specific module is being skipped in the simulation workflow and what is the reason for skipping it?

**Answer:** The ZDC module is being skipped in the simulation workflow. This is achieved by adding the command-line option "--skipModules ZDC" to the workflow configuration. The reason for skipping this module is not explicitly stated in the provided document, but it likely relates to optimizing the simulation process or focusing on other specific aspects of the simulation that do not require the ZDC module.
