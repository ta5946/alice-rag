**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--onlyDet` option in the given workflow and how does it interact with the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` variable?

**Answer:** The `--onlyDet` option in the given workflow is used to specify which detectors should be included in the processing. It interacts with the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` variable, which contains a list of detectors to be processed. By setting `--onlyDet $WORKFLOW_DETECTORS`, the workflow is configured to only process the detectors listed in the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` variable, effectively filtering the processing to those specific detectors.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `EMCALRawToCellConverterSpec` configuration parameter `--fitmethod` and what are the possible values it can take?

**Answer:** The `EMCALRawToCellConverterSpec` configuration parameter `--fitmethod` is used to specify the method for fitting the raw data to obtain cell values. The possible value it can take is `gamma2`, which indicates the use of a gamma2 fitting method for this conversion process.

**Question:** What is the value of the `NCPU` variable and what command is used to determine its value in the script?

**Answer:** The value of the `NCPU` variable is set to `20` in the script. However, there is a commented-out command intended to determine its value dynamically using the number of CPU cores, which is `$(grep ^cpu\\scores /proc/cpuinfo | uniq |  awk '{print $4}')`.
