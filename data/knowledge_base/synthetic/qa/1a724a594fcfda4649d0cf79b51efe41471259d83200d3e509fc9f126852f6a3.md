**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--cpu-limit 32` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command?

**Answer:** The `--cpu-limit 32` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command is used to allow increased timeframe parallelism, specifically capping the number of CPU cores that the workflow will utilize to 32. This helps in managing resource usage and can improve performance by optimizing how tasks are distributed across available CPU cores.

**Question:** What is the trigger configuration used in the workflow for particle detection with a specific pdg code and pt range?

**Answer:** The trigger configuration used for particle detection with a specific pdg code and pt range in the workflow is set as follows: 

- pdg code of 4122
- pt minimum of 0.5 GeV
- y range from -0.5 to 0.5

This is specified in the command with the `-confKey` parameter as: `TriggerParticle.pdg=4122;TriggerParticle.ptMin=0.5;TriggerParticle.yMin=-0.5;TriggerParticle.yMax=0.5`.
