**Question:** What is the purpose of the `-tt aod` flag in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command, and how does it affect the output of the workflow?

**Answer:** The `-tt aod` flag in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command specifies that the output should be in the form of an AOD (Analysis Object Data) file. This flag ensures that the workflow generates and outputs AOD files, which are optimized for subsequent analysis tasks within the O2 framework. The use of AOD files streamlines the data processing pipeline by providing a structured format that is well-suited for further analysis and validation steps.
