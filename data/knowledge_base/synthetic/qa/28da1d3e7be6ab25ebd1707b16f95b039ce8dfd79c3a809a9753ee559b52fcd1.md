**Question:** What actions are taken when the "modify" command is executed and what arguments are required for this action?

**Answer:** When the "modify" command is executed, the following actions are taken:

- An input configuration can be specified using the `--config` or `-c` argument.
- An output file name for the new configuration can be provided using the `--output` or `-o` argument. If not provided, the default output file name is `analyses_config.json`.
- Analysis task names to enable can be specified using the `--enable-tasks` argument, which accepts multiple task names.
- Analysis task names to disable can be specified using the `--disable-tasks` argument, which also accepts multiple task names and takes precedence over `--enable-tasks`.

These arguments allow users to modify the analysis configuration by enabling or disabling specific tasks as needed.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `include_disabled` variable and how does it get updated in the function?

**Answer:** The `include_disabled` variable is used to determine whether or not to check analyses that are by default disabled. It is initially set based on the `args.include_disabled` parameter. This variable gets updated within the function if `args.tasks` are specified. If `args.tasks` are provided and `analysis_name` (the name of the current analysis) is found within `args.tasks`, `include_disabled` is set to `True`, ensuring that even disabled analyses are checked.

---

**Question:** What specific actions are taken if the specified analysis task is not found in the configurations?

**Answer:** If the specified analysis task is not found in the configurations, the document indicates that a warning message "WARNING: Unknown task [task_name]" is printed, where [task_name] is the name provided in the arguments. Then, the function returns 1 to signify an error.

---

**Question:** What is the default path used by the `get_config` function to locate the `analyses_config.json` file?

**Answer:** The default path used by the `get_config` function to locate the `analyses_config.json` file is `join(O2DPG_ROOT, "MC", "config", "analysis_testing", "json", "analyses_config.json")`.

---

**Question:** What is the default behavior of the `validate-output` task if no specific analysis tasks are provided via the `--tasks` argument?

**Answer:** If no specific analysis tasks are provided via the `--tasks` argument, all analyses are validated by default.

---

**Question:** What does the `--applicable-to` flag do when used with the `check` command?

**Answer:** The `--applicable-to` flag, when used with the `check` command, checks whether the specified analysis task is valid for Monte Carlo (MC) or data.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the exit code from the log file is non-zero for the analysis named "analysis_name"?

**Answer:** If the exit code from the log file is non-zero for the analysis named "analysis_name", the following actions are taken:
- The message "Analysis analysis_name had non-zero exit code [exit_code]." is printed.
- The variable `ret` is set to 1.
- The loop is exited using the `break` statement.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the expected output directory for an analysis does not exist?

**Answer:** If the expected output directory for an analysis does not exist, the script prints a message indicating that the directory does not exist and sets the return value `ret` to 1 before continuing with the next iteration.

---

**Question:** What does the `check` function print when the `--status` option is provided, and how does it determine the status of the analysis tasks?

**Answer:** When the `--status` option is provided to the `check` function, it prints "ENABLED" or "DISABLED" based on the status of the analysis tasks. The function determines this status by examining the `enabled` field of each task in the `analyses` list, which is loaded from the configuration file specified by `args.config`. If `enabled` is `True`, it prints "ENABLED"; otherwise, it prints "DISABLED".
