**Question:** What is the probability that the configuration name will be "GeneratorHF_bbbarToDDbarToDielectrons.ini" based on the random number generation logic provided in the script?

**Answer:** The probability that the configuration name will be "GeneratorHF_bbbarToDDbarToDielectrons.ini" is 60%. This is because the random number generated falls within the range of 40 to 99, which constitutes 60% of the possible outcomes (100 total possible values).
