**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--inject-missing-data` option in the o2-dpl-raw-proxy command, and how does it affect the data processing pipeline?

**Answer:** The `--inject-missing-data` option in the `o2-dpl-raw-proxy` command is used to fill in gaps or missing data in the raw input data stream. This is particularly useful in scenarios where some data packets might be lost or not received properly, ensuring that the data processing pipeline receives a complete and consistent set of data for further analysis. By injecting missing data, the pipeline can maintain a continuous flow of data, which is essential for the proper functioning of downstream processing stages. This option helps in reducing the impact of data loss and ensures that the subsequent stages of data processing are not adversely affected by incomplete data sets.
