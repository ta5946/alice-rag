**Question:** How can you modify the value of a configurable parameter during a simulation run, and what are the two primary methods to do so?

**Answer:** You can modify the value of a configurable parameter during a simulation run using two primary methods: configuration files and command line options. Specifically, you can use the `--configFile` option to specify a file containing the parameter settings, or the `--configKeyValues` option to directly set key-value pairs for the parameters.

**Question:** How does the DPL ensure that the `DataHeader.firstTForbit` value is correct for the TF containing the first sample when using the `HBFUtils` settings from the `o2-sim-digitizer-workflow`?

**Answer:** The DPL ensures that the `DataHeader.firstTForbit` value is correct for the TF containing the first sample by making sure it aligns with `HBFUtils.orbitFirstSampled`. Specifically, `DataHeader.firstTForbit` is set to correspond to the 1st orbit of the TF that contains `HBFUtils.orbitFirstSampled`. For subsequent TFs within the same digitization file that contain multiple TF entries, `DataHeader.firstTForbit` is incremented by `HBFUtils.nHBFPerTF`.

**Question:** What is the impact on communication between simulation processes when the `ALICE_NOSIMSHM` environment variable is set?

**Answer:** When the `ALICE_NOSIMSHM` environment variable is set, communication between simulation processes will no longer utilize a shared memory mechanism. Instead, communication will be handled through ROOT serialization.

---

**Question:** What are the two main resources mentioned for learning how to use the simulation and digitization tools, and where are they located?

**Answer:** The two main resources mentioned for learning how to use the simulation and digitization tools are:

1. Examples for the usage of simulation and digitization, which are located in the [examples folder](../run/SimExamples).
2. Scripts used for regression testing, which can be found in the [prodtests](../prodtests) directory.

**Question:** What is the role of the GRP updater process in the digitization workflow, and how does it contribute to the overall simulation process?

**Answer:** The GRP updater process in the digitization workflow is tasked with updating the GRP (Geometry Root Parameter) file with information acquired during the digitization process. This contribution is crucial as it ensures that the geometric parameters of the detector, which are essential for the simulation and analysis, are accurately reflected and updated. By incorporating new data from digitization, the GRP file remains a reliable and up-to-date reference for the entire simulation and subsequent analysis stages, ensuring consistency and precision in the handling of detector geometry.

**Question:** What specific conditions must an external trigger function meet to be compatible with the O2 simulation framework, and how is it integrated into the simulation process?

**Answer:** An external trigger function for the O2 simulation framework must comply with a simple protocol and be integrated via command line arguments. The function should return a lambda function with the following signature:

```cpp
o2::eventgen::Trigger the_function()
{
  return [](const std::vector<TParticle>& particles) -> bool {
    // Custom logic to define the trigger
    return true; // Example: always trigger
  };
}
```

To integrate this function, use the command line argument format:

```
o2-sim -g pythia8pp -t external --configKeyValues 'TriggerExternal.fileName=path_to_trigger_macro.C;TriggerExternal.funcName="the_function(some, parameters)"'
```

The trigger is activated when the lambda function returns `true`, initiating the simulation of the current event. The function can inspect the particle stack to define any desired trigger logic.

**Question:** How does the `HBFUtils.orbitFirstSampled` parameter influence the sampling process in the `InteractionSampler`, and which other parameters are involved in defining the start-of-the-run flag in the raw data header?

**Answer:** `HBFUtils.orbitFirstSampled` tells the `InteractionSampler` the orbit from which the sampling should start. For defining the start-of-the-run flag in the raw data header, `HBFUtils.orbitFirstSampled` is used, while `HBFUtils.nHBFPerTF` is involved in chopping the digitized data into Time Frames (TFs).

---

**Question:** Which examples in the document demonstrate generator configuration for embedding that adapt to specific properties of the background event?

**Answer:** The examples that demonstrate generator configuration for embedding which adapt to specific properties of the background event are:

- [Adaptive_Pythia8]: This example showcases a generator configuration for embedding that adapts the response based on the background event.
- [Signal_ImpactB]: This example illustrates a generator configuration for embedding that adapts to the impact parameter of the background event.

**Question:** What would be the command to perform digitization for only the TOF detector with a specified LHC interaction rate of 5e5, using digits from a simulation prefix named "test"?

**Answer:** o2-sim-digitizer-workflow --sims test -b --onlyDet TOF --interactionRate 5e5

---

**Question:** What are the specific requirements and differences for the function that needs to be defined when using a 'DeepTrigger' compared to a normal trigger in the O2 simulation documentation?

**Answer:** The function required for a 'DeepTrigger' must adhere to a protocol that differs from a normal trigger function. Specifically, a 'DeepTrigger' function must return a lambda function with the following signature:

```cpp
o2::eventgen::DeepTrigger the_deep_function()
{
  return [mpiMin](void* interface, std::string name) -> bool {
    return true;
  };
}
```

This lambda function takes two parameters: a pointer to the event-generator interface (`void* interface`) and a string (`std::string name`) that represents the name of the trigger. The lambda must return a boolean value.

Compared to a normal trigger, the primary difference lies in the type of function returned and its arguments. Normal triggers typically do not have direct access to the event-generator interface or the name of the trigger as string parameters.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the deep triggers functionality in the context of event generation, and how does it differ from previous trigger implementations?

**Answer:** The deep triggers functionality allows users to define custom triggers that can access internal event-generator machinery, such as counters and information not available in the particle stack. This is distinct from previous trigger implementations which typically only had access to the stack of generated particles. Users can implement custom lambda functions that interact directly with the event generator interface, providing more flexibility and capability for trigger definitions.

---

**Question:** What specific command line arguments are required to set up a particle trigger with a specific PDG code, minimum transverse momentum, and pseudorapidity range in the O2 event generator?

**Answer:** o2-sim -g pythia8pp -t particle --configKeyValues "TriggerParticle.pdg=YOUR_PDG_CODE;TriggerParticle.ptMin=YOUR_MIN_PT;TriggerParticle.yMin=YOUR_MIN_Y;TriggerParticle.yMax=YOUR_MAX_Y"

---

**Question:** What happens if multiple simulation prefixes are provided with the `--sims` option, and how is the final collision event composed?

**Answer:** If multiple simulation prefixes are provided with the `--sims` option, the final collision event is composed by overlaying or embedding the transport simulation productions from each prefix in a round robin fashion. For example, if `--sims background,signal` is specified, the simulation will alternately generate events from the `background` and `signal` prefixes until the desired event count is reached.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of using a `MCTruthContainer` in the O2 simulation framework, and how does it contribute to the management of Monte Carlo truth information?

**Answer:** The purpose of using a `MCTruthContainer` in the O2 simulation framework is to associate digits with multiple labels, ensuring that each digit can be linked to the relevant Monte Carlo track, event, and source kinematics information. This container is stored as a separate branch in the output file alongside the digit branch, allowing for efficient memory management while maintaining close proximity to the raw digit data. By using this approach, the framework can accommodate an arbitrary number of labels with minimal additional memory cost, facilitating precise lookup and loading of the corresponding Monte Carlo track information.

---

**Question:** What command-line option should be used to ensure that the generated events share the same interaction vertex as the background events stored in `o2sim.background.root`, and how does the simulation handle the reuse of background events?

**Answer:** The command-line option to ensure that the generated events share the same interaction vertex as the background events stored in `o2sim.background.root` is:

```
o2-sim --embedIntoFile o2sim.background.root
```

The simulation handles the reuse of background events by sampling them one-by-one. Once all background events have been used, they start to be reused.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--incontext` and `--outcontext` options, and how do they interact with the digitization process in the ALICE O2 simulation?

**Answer:** The `--incontext` and `--outcontext` options in the ALICE O2 simulation are used for managing context files, which store metadata and settings required for the digitization process. Specifically:

- `--incontext`: This option specifies the name of a context file that can be used to reuse settings from a previous run. It is particularly useful when processing data detector-wise and needs to apply the same configuration across different segments.

- `--outcontext`: This option allows the user to specify the name of the context file to be produced after the simulation. It can be used to store the settings and metadata from the current simulation run, which can then be reused in subsequent runs to maintain consistency.

These options interact with the digitization process by providing a mechanism to persist and transfer configuration settings between runs. This is beneficial for ensuring that the same conditions and settings are applied across multiple stages or runs of the simulation, which is crucial for maintaining reproducibility and consistency in the digitization and analysis of detector data in the ALICE experiment.

**Question:** What specific parameters are required to configure BoxGen for generating forward muons with a particular PDG code, eta range, and number of particles per event?

**Answer:** To configure BoxGen for generating forward muons with a specific PDG code, eta range, and number of particles per event, you need to use the `--configKeyValues` option to specify the following parameters:

- `BoxGun.pdg`: Set the PDG code for the particles, e.g., 13 for muons.
- `BoxGun.eta[0]`: Set the lower bound of the eta range.
- `BoxGun.eta[1]`: Set the upper bound of the eta range.
- `BoxGun.number`: Set the number of particles to generate per event.

For example, to generate 100 forward muons with a PDG code of 13, within an eta range from -3.6 to -2.45, the command would look like this:

```
o2-sim -m PIPE ITS MFT -e TGeant3 -g boxgen -n 10 --configKeyValues 'BoxGun.pdg=13 ; BoxGun.eta[0]=-3.6 ; BoxGun.eta[1]=-2.45; BoxGun.number=100'
```

**Question:** What is the default value for the number of parallel simulation engine workers and how is it determined?

**Answer:** The default value for the number of parallel simulation engine workers is half the number of hyperthread CPU cores.

---

**Question:** What does the `deep trigger` function return when it receives an interface of type "pythia8" and the name "pythia8", and how is the MPI (minimum number of partons) requirement checked?

**Answer:** The `deep trigger` function returns a lambda function when it receives an interface of type "pythia8" and the name "pythia8". This lambda function checks if the interface is of type `Pythia8::Pythia*` and then verifies if the number of MPI (minimum number of partons) is greater than or equal to the specified `mpiMin` value. If the condition is met, the lambda function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

**Question:** What are the key steps and flags necessary to use the `MCReplay` engine in O2 for replaying a simulation, and how do they ensure the preservation of hit files from the reference run?

**Answer:** To use the `MCReplay` engine in O2 for replaying a simulation, the following key steps and flags are necessary:

1. Create a file containing logged steps by following the instructions in the `MCStepLogger` section.
2. Run `o2-sim-serial` with the following flags:
   - `-n <ref_nevents>`: Specifies the number of events to replay.
   - `-e MCReplay`: Indicates that the engine to be used is `MCReplay`.
   - `-g extkinO2`: Specifies the external kinematics file.
   - `--extKinFile o2sim_Kine.root`: Provides the name of the external kinematics file.
   - `-o replay`: Sets the output prefix for the replayed simulation, different from the original run to avoid overwriting hit files.

These steps and flags ensure the preservation of hit files from the reference run by using a distinct output prefix for the replayed data, preventing the overwrite of any valuable information that could be needed for analysis.

---

**Question:** What criteria are used in the `doVetoPartonLevel` method to decide whether to veto a parton-level event in the simulation?

**Answer:** The `doVetoPartonLevel` method vetoes a parton-level event if it encounters a charm quark (with an absolute particle ID of 4) that has an absolute rapidity value greater than 1.5. If no such charm quark is found, the event is not vetoed and is allowed to proceed.

---

**Question:** How would you modify the command line arguments to use the vertex position from an existing `Kinematics.root` file for generating new events while preserving the background characteristics?

**Answer:** To modify the command line arguments for using the vertex position from an existing `Kinematics.root` file while preserving the background characteristics, you would use:

```
o2-sim -g extkin --extKinFile Kinematics.root --vertexKinematics
```

---

**Question:** What would be the command to start the raw data creation from the 5th orbit instead of the 2nd TF, and how would you limit the raw data to include only the first 10 orbits from the start-of-run?

**Answer:** ```o2-ft0-digi2raw --configKeyValues "HBFUtils.orbitFirst=5" "HBFUtils.maxNOrbits=10"```

This command starts the raw data creation from the 5th orbit and limits the data to include only the first 10 orbits from the start-of-run.

---

**Question:** What are the key differences in the pipeline stages and parallelism used in the [sim_challenge.sh] script compared to the [sim_performance.sh] script?

**Answer:** In the [sim_challenge.sh] script, a simple transport, digitization, and reconstruction pipeline is employed, with all stages utilizing parallelism. In contrast, the [sim_performance.sh] script implements a serial transport and a linearized digitization sequence where each detector is processed one after another, without parallelism among stages.

---

**Question:** How does the sub-event parallelism feature in the Run3 simulation contribute to reducing memory consumption?

**Answer:** The sub-event parallelism feature in the Run3 simulation contributes to reducing memory consumption by enabling the transportation of a single large event in a shorter time frame. This parallel processing approach allows for the distribution of the event into smaller sub-events, which can be processed concurrently. By doing so, the system can manage and handle the memory requirements more efficiently, leading to a reduction in overall memory usage during the simulation process.

---

**Question:** What are the HBFUtils parameters used to control the interaction sampling in the o2-sim digitizer workflow, and how do they affect the output?

**Answer:** The HBFUtils parameters used to control the interaction sampling in the o2-sim digitizer workflow are:

- `HBFUtils.nHBFPerTF`: This parameter specifies the number of HBF (Hybrid Bit Frame) units per Trigger Frame (TF). A higher value will increase the granularity of the sampling, allowing for more interactions to be sampled per TF.

- `HBFUtils.orbitFirst`: This parameter sets the first orbit number where the interaction sampling begins. It defines the starting point in the bunch crossing sequence.

- `HBFUtils.orbitFirstSampled`: This parameter indicates the first orbit number that will be sampled for interactions. It effectively skips a certain number of orbits at the beginning of the bunch filling before starting to sample.

These parameters collectively influence the output by determining when and how often interactions are sampled within the bunch crossing sequence, ensuring that the digitizers receive the correct set of events according to the specified interaction rate and bunch filling schema.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--skipModules` option in the `o2-sim` executable and how might it affect the simulation process?

**Answer:** The `--skipModules` option in the `o2-sim` executable allows the user to specify modules that should be omitted from the simulation process. By using this option with values like `ZDC,PHS`, the user instructs the simulation to exclude the ZDC (Zero Degree Calorimeter) and PHS (Polarized Hadron Spectrometer) modules from the topology of sub-processes that interact during the simulation.

Omitting certain modules can affect the simulation in several ways:
- **Reduced complexity:** The simulation will be less complex and potentially faster, as fewer processes are involved.
- **Focused analysis:** If the analysis does not require data from ZDC and PHS, skipping these modules can streamline the simulation to focus on other parts of the detector.
- **Memory and resource usage:** Less memory and computational resources will be needed for the simulation, as these modules are not instantiated and their interactions are not processed.
- **Output data:** The output data will lack hits and signals related to the ZDC and PHS, which may be beneficial if the analysis is not concerned with these specific parts of the detector.

---

**Question:** What additional steps are required to analyze the `MCStepLoggerOutput.root` file produced by the simulation?

**Answer:** To analyze the `MCStepLoggerOutput.root` file produced by the simulation, you need to use the special analysis framework provided in the VMCStepLogger project. Refer to the documentation at https://github.com/AliceO2Group/VMCStepLogger/blob/master/README.md for detailed instructions on how to proceed with the analysis.

---

**Question:** What command-line arguments and configuration settings would be required to run this simulation, and which files would be produced as output?

**Answer:** To run this simulation, the following command-line arguments and configuration settings would be required:

```bash
o2sim -n 10 -m 2 --detector-config "all_except_ZDC_PHOS" --sim-impl Geant4
```

This command specifies 10 Pythia8 events, 2 parallel worker processes, and excludes ZDC and PHOS from the simulation. The `--detector-config "all_except_ZDC_PHOS"` setting ensures that all detectors except ZDC and PHOS are included. 

The simulation would produce the following output files:

| File                  | Description                                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `o2sim_Kine.root`     | contains kinematics information (primaries and secondaries) and event meta information |
| `o2sim_geometry.root` | contains the final ROOT geometry created for simulation run                            |
| `o2sim_grp.root`      | special global run parameters (grp) such as field                                      |
| `o2sim_XXXHits.root`  | hit file for each participating active detector XXX                                    |

**Question:** What steps are necessary to modify and apply changes to medium parameters for the ALICE O2 simulation, and what limitation should be considered when using Geant4 for transport?

**Answer:** To modify and apply changes to medium parameters for the ALICE O2 simulation, follow these steps:

1. Extract the current medium parameters into a `JSON` file using the command:
   ```bash
   o2-sim <args> --configKeyValues "MaterialManagerParam.outputFile=medium_params.json"
   ```
2. Edit the `medium_params.json` file to make the desired changes.
3. Pass the modified `medium_params.json` as an input for the target simulation with the command:
   ```bash
   o2-sim <args> --configKeyValues "MaterialManagerParam.inputFile=medium_params.json"
   ```

It is important to note that process parameters do not have any effect when Geant4 is used for transport.

---

**Question:** What happens if both `--configFile` and `--configKeyValues` are provided in the command line, and how does the system handle the prioritization of configuration parameters?

**Answer:** If both `--configFile` and `--configKeyValues` are provided in the command line, the system will prioritize the parameters set using `--configKeyValues`. This means that any parameters specified through `--configKeyValues` will take precedence over those defined in the configuration file specified by `--configFile`.

---

**Question:** Which example demonstrates the use of the inhibit-pause-trigger-continue approach for simulating a specific set of particles?

**Answer:** Selective_Transport_pi0 demonstrates the use of the inhibit-pause-trigger-continue approach for simulating a specific set of particles.

---

**Question:** What does the `MCKinematicsReader` class require to initialize, and how can it be used to access Monte Carlo tracks associated with a specific label?

**Answer:** The `MCKinematicsReader` class requires the digitization context file to initialize. This file is generated during the digitization process. Once initialized, it can be used to retrieve Monte Carlo tracks associated with a specific label.

A typical usage involves initializing the reader with the path to the context file:
```c++
o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader reader("collisioncontext.root");
```

To access Monte Carlo tracks for a specific label, you would call a method on the `reader` object that takes the label as an argument. For example:
```c++
// Assuming the reader has a method to get tracks for a given label
std::vector<o2::MCCompLabel> mcTracks = reader.getTracksForLabel("someLabel");
```

This will return a vector of `o2::MCCompLabel` objects, each representing a Monte Carlo track associated with the specified label.

---

**Question:** What are the two main components of detector simulation mentioned in the document, and how are they handled in the simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The two main components of detector simulation mentioned in the document are:

1. The generation of simple (energy deposit) traces in the detector due to the passage of particles and their interaction with the detector material.
2. The conversion of those traces into (electronic) signals in the detector readout (digitization).

These components are handled in the simulation workflow as follows:
- The generation of traces is managed by the `o2-sim` executable.
- Digitization of the traces is handled by the `o2-sim-digitizer-workflow` executable.

---

**Question:** Which parameters in the document can influence the particle stack, and what specific aspects can they affect?

**Answer:** Parameters in the document that can influence the particle stack include:

- Stack: This parameter affects aspects such as whether the stack performs kinematics pruning and whether it retains secondaries.

---

**Question:** What configuration parameter is used to set the energy cut for particles, and what is the effect of setting this parameter?

**Answer:** The configuration parameter used to set the energy cut for particles is `MCReplayParam.energyCut`. By setting this parameter, particles with an energy below the specified threshold are discarded. This action can make the detector simulation faster and more efficient, as it omits steps with negligible impact on the hits and digits.

---

**Question:** How would you access and process the labels for the third digit in the `mDigits` collection using the provided container structure?

**Answer:** To access and process the labels for the third digit in the `mDigits` collection, you would use the following code:

```c++
const auto& digit = mDigits[2]; // Get the third digit (index 2)
const auto& labels_for_digit = mLabelContainer.getLabels(2); // Get labels for the third digit
for (auto& label : labels_for_digit) { // Iterate over the labels
   // Process each label
}
```

---

**Question:** What information is stored in the `collisioncontext.root` file and how does it contribute to the digitization process?

**Answer:** The `collisioncontext.root` file stores information about the collision and digitization context utilized during the digitization process. It includes details such as the list of input files, the composition of collisions for the digitization, and the time stamps assigned during the embedding process. This file aids in maintaining a comprehensive record of the conditions under which the digitization occurred, ensuring reproducibility and traceability of the results.

---

**Question:** What mechanism is used to ensure that different event generators, which are orthogonal to each other, can be passed and correctly used in the simulation framework?

**Answer:** A `void*` is utilized as a generic pointer to accommodate various types of event generators. This approach enables the passing of different generators without type constraints. Each generator is associated with a unique string identifier. Upon receiving the `void*`, the system performs a typecast based on this identifier to ensure the correct handling and utilization of the specific event generator in the simulation framework.

---

**Question:** What specific condition does the described functionality allow users to veto events based on during the Pythia8 event generation process?

**Answer:** The described functionality allows users to veto events based on the absence of charm partons in Pythia8 during the event generation process, before the hadronization of partons.

---

**Question:** What action is required if you need to generate raw data from the first sampled Time Frame (TF) instead of from the trigger overview (SOX) in continuous readout mode?

**Answer:** To generate raw data starting from the first sampled Time Frame (TF) instead of from the trigger overview (SOX) in continuous readout mode, you need to override the `HBFUtils.orbitFirst` property with the orbit corresponding to the first sampled TF.

---

**Question:** How can you ensure that the generated events in the ALICE O2 simulation match exactly those produced by an AliRoot simulation?

**Answer:** To ensure that the generated events in the ALICE O2 simulation match exactly those produced by an AliRoot simulation, you need to use the same event generator, configuration settings, and parameters as in the AliRoot simulation. This can be achieved by using the `-g external` command line option followed by a ROOT macro that sets up the event generator in the same way it is configured in AliRoot. Additionally, make sure to use identical seeds for random number generation and match the geometry and detector settings.

---

**Question:** What specific steps are required to ensure the `o2sim_hitmergerlog` file is generated correctly, and how does this process integrate with other simulation log files?

**Answer:** To ensure the `o2sim_hitmergerlog` file is generated correctly, the simulation must proceed through the IO process stage. This involves the successful completion of the transportation processes, as documented in `o2sim_workerlog`. After the particles have been transported and merged into hits, the IO process records these events in the `o2sim_hitmergerlog` file.

The `o2sim_hitmergerlog` integrates with other simulation log files as follows:

- It follows the `o2sim_workerlog` in the sequence of events, as the transportation processes must be completed before hits can be merged and recorded.
- The `o2sim_hitmergerlog` is generated concurrently with the creation of the `o2sim_serverlog`, as both processes occur during the simulation run. The server log documents the actions of the particle generator server, which provides the input data for the IO process that produces the hit merger log.

Overall, the successful generation of the `o2sim_hitmergerlog` relies on the proper functioning of preceding processes, particularly the transportation and merging steps, and it is a critical component in the comprehensive logging of the simulation.

---

**Question:** What are the potential impacts of using different values for the `-t` option on the simulation performance and output data size?

**Answer:** The `-t` option in the ALICE O2 simulation likely controls the time step or the duration of the simulation. Different values for this option can significantly impact the simulation performance and output data size. Smaller time steps can increase the accuracy of the simulation by capturing more detailed particle interactions but will also require more computational resources, potentially extending the simulation runtime. Conversely, larger time steps can reduce the computational load and time required for the simulation, but may sacrifice some accuracy, leading to less detailed output data. The output data size will be directly influenced by the number of events and steps processed during the simulation; finer time steps will generally result in larger datasets due to the increased number of interactions recorded.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of using `o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader` in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation, and how does initializing it in a different mode affect the data access compared to the example provided in the document?

**Answer:** The `o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader` is utilized in the ALICE O2 simulation for accessing kinematic data, which includes information about particles' momentum, position, and other dynamic properties. In the context of the provided code snippet, the reader is initialized to work with kinematics data that has already been processed through the transport simulation, as indicated by the mode `o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader::Mode::kMCKine`.

Initializing the `MCKinematicsReader` in this specific mode affects the data access in that it enables the retrieval of kinematic data that reflects the state of particles after they have been transported through the detector. This is in contrast to the example provided in the document, where the reader iterates over digits and tracks that are directly associated with digitized detector signals. By using the transport kinematics mode, the reader can access updated kinematic information, which might be necessary for analyses that require the particle's state after interactions within the detector, such as particle identification or kinematic fits.

In summary, using `o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader` with a different mode allows access to kinematic data that has been post-processed, providing more accurate and updated information about particles compared to the raw digitized signals, which are used in the example provided.
