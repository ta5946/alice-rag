## Content

**Question:** What actions are taken if the byte content of the two ROOT files is different according to the provided script?

**Answer:** If the byte content of the two ROOT files is different, the script prints "Byte content of the two ROOT files is different.", followed by the names of the two files, args.file1 and args.file2.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `get_total_branch_list` function in this script?

**Answer:** The `get_total_branch_list` function in this script is designed to recursively collect all branches, including sub-branches, from a given ROOT tree. It starts by obtaining the top-level branches of the tree and then traverses through any nested branches to compile a comprehensive list of all branches present, which is useful for comparing the structure of ROOT files.

**Question:** What would happen if the `get_total_branch_list` function returns different sets of branches for `tree1` and `tree2`?

**Answer:** If the `get_total_branch_list` function returns different sets of branches for `tree1` and `tree2`, the `compare_trees` function will detect this discrepancy because it relies on the branch lists from both trees. Since `branches1` and `branches2` are expected to contain the same branches for the trees to be considered equal, any difference in the returned branch lists would lead to the function returning `False`, indicating that the trees do not match.

**Question:** What will happen if the types of objects corresponding to keys in the two ROOT files are different?

**Answer:** If the types of objects corresponding to keys in the two ROOT files are different, the function will set `success` to False.

**Question:** What is the purpose of using two hash sets containing tuples of (branchname, totalsize) in this code?

**Answer:** The purpose of using two hash sets containing tuples of (branchname, totalsize) in this code is to compare the contents of two sets of branches without relying on their order. By converting the branch names and their total sizes into tuples and adding them to respective hash sets, the code can efficiently check if the two sets of branches have the same content, regardless of their order.
