**Question:** What is the purpose of the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable in this script and what library does it load?

**Answer:** The `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable is used to specify a library that should be loaded into the process's address space and used by the dynamic linker to intercept calls to specific functions. In this script, it loads the `libMCStepLoggerInterceptSteps.so` library, which is located in the `$MCSTEPLOGGER_ROOT/lib/` directory. This library intercepts function calls to allow the steplogger to monitor and log simulation steps.
