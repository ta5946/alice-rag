**Question:** What is the purpose of the `registerMapND` function in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation, and what parameters does it take?

**Answer:** The `registerMapND` function in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation is used to register a multidimensional map. It takes the following parameters:

- `name`: A unique string identifier for the map.
- `tree`: A pointer to the source TTree from which the map data will be extracted.
- `exactDims`: A vector of strings representing the exact coordinate names for the map dimensions.
- `nearestDim`: A string specifying the dimension that will be used for nearest match interpolation.
- `valueVar`: A string indicating the variable to be interpolated for the map.
- `selection`: A string containing the TTree selection criteria to filter the data before mapping.

**Question:** What is the purpose of using `treeFastCache1D.C` in the context of TTree analysis, and how does it enhance the performance of interactive analysis tasks?

**Answer:** The purpose of using `treeFastCache1D.C` in TTree analysis is to provide a fast lookup and interpolation mechanism for 1D data from TTrees, specifically tailored for interactive analysis scenarios. It enhances performance by enabling nearest-neighbor lookup using `std::map<double, float>` data structures, which significantly speeds up the evaluation process when used inside `TTree::Draw`. This is particularly beneficial for tasks such as generating QA plots, calibration overlays, or smoothed time series, as it allows for quicker and more responsive analysis without the need for lengthy data processing.

**Question:** What is the purpose of using an exact match in N-1 dimensions and a nearest-neighbor lookup in 1 dimension within the ND caching mechanism described in `treeFastCacheND.C`?

**Answer:** The purpose of using an exact match in N-1 dimensions and a nearest-neighbor lookup in 1 dimension within the ND caching mechanism described in `treeFastCacheND.C` is to optimize query performance. For the dimension where exact matches are required (N-1 dimensions), the system ensures precise and fast lookups. Meanwhile, the nearest-neighbor search in the remaining dimension (e.g., `time`) allows for efficient handling of continuous or nearly continuous data, reducing the computational overhead compared to searching through all possible values. This combination enables quick access to relevant data subsets while maintaining accuracy in critical dimensions.

**Question:** What is the data structure used to store the ND (N-dimensional) caches, and how is it indexed?

**Answer:** The data structure used to store the ND (N-dimensional) caches is a map with the following structure:

```cpp
std::map<int, std::map<std::vector<double>, std::map<double, double>>>
```

It is indexed in a hierarchical manner:

1. The outermost map uses an integer key (`int`), likely representing some unique identifier or ID.
2. The value associated with this integer key is another map, where the keys are vectors of doubles (`std::vector<double>`). These vector keys probably represent the coordinates or parameters of the N-dimensional space.
3. The value associated with the vector key is yet another map, where the keys are doubles and the values are also doubles. This innermost map likely holds the actual data points or values in the N-dimensional space, indexed by their corresponding coordinates.
