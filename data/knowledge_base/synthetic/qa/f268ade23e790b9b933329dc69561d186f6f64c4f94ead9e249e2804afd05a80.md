**Question:** What is the maximum number of CPU cores that can be utilized according to the command provided, and how does this affect the parallelism of the workflow?

**Answer:** The maximum number of CPU cores that can be utilized according to the command provided is 32. This is specified by the --cpu-limit option set to ${CPU_LIMIT}, where ${CPU_LIMIT} is defined as 32 in this context. This setting allows for increased parallelism in the workflow, enabling more tasks to be processed simultaneously within the AOD (Analysis Object Data) framework. By increasing the timeframe parallelism with a higher CPU limit, the workflow can handle more complex and resource-intensive tasks more efficiently.
