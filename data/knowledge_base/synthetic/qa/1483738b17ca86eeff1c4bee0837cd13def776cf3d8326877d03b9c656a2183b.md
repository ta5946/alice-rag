**Question:** What is the command used to update the "NEVENTS" field in the jsonFile, and what does it replace in the file?

**Answer:** The command used to update the "NEVENTS" field in the jsonFile is:

```
sed -i '/"NEVENTS"/c\" + nl + "' " + jsonFile
```

This command replaces the line containing `"NEVENTS"` in the file with the new value. Specifically, it updates the `"NEVENTS"` field to be:

```
    "NEVENTS"    : [args.nEvents],
```

where `args.nEvents` is the number of events specified as a command line argument.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `procdefs["RES"]` variable in the script, and how does it affect the contents of the JSON file?

**Answer:** The `procdefs["RES"]` variable in the script contains the value for the RES key in the JSON configuration. If `procdefs["RES"]` is an empty string, the script appends a line to the JSON file defining RES as an empty list: `"RES" : []`. Otherwise, it uses the value of `procdefs["RES"]` to populate the RES key in the JSON file. This allows for flexibility in configuring the RES parameter, either by setting it to an empty list or providing a specific list of values.
