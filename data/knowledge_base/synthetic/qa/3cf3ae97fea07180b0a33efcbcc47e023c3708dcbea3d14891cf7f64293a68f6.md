**Question:** What configuration parameter should be set to specify a minimum energy cut for particles produced in the simulation, and what is the default value if not specified?

**Answer:** The configuration parameter to set a minimum energy cut for particles produced in the simulation is `MCReplayParam.energyCut`. If this parameter is not specified, there is no default value provided in the document, and particles of any energy would be included by default.

**Question:** What factors should be considered to ensure consistency between the current simulation and the reference run?

**Answer:** To ensure consistency between the current simulation and the reference run, it is crucial to use or exclude the exact same modules as those used in the reference run. This can be managed through the `-m` and `--skipModules` flags, as detailed in the README.md under the section on simulation geometry, modules, and detectors.

**Question:** What specific condition must be met for the O2TrivialMCEngine to be automatically selected during the simulation process?

**Answer:** The O2TrivialMCEngine will be automatically selected during the simulation process when the user initiates a run with the command `o2-sim --noGeant`, indicating that only the kinematics of primaries are of interest and no real engine is needed.

**Question:** What is the MCReplay engine used for in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation framework?

**Answer:** The MCReplay engine is used to replay a simulation based on steps logged by the MCStepLogger. It does not perform actual simulations but instead mimics one by injecting each step, one after the other, from a previous simulation.
