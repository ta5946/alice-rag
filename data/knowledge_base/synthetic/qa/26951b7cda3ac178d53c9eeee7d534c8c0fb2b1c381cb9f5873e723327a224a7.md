**Question:** What is the purpose of the `get_workflow_creation_from_script` function in the provided script?

**Answer:** The `get_workflow_creation_from_script` function is designed to extract the line from a provided script file that creates a workflow. Specifically, it searches for the part of the script where the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` file is referenced, and concatenates the relevant lines into a single continuous line, removing any line breaks. This function helps in isolating the workflow creation logic from the rest of the script, making it easier to analyze or modify just the workflow setup part.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the variable `has_no_wf` in the script, and how does it affect the output script?

**Answer:** The variable `has_no_wf` is initialized to 1 to indicate that the script has not yet found the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` command, which is the marker for the start of the workflow creation section. This variable is used to control the flow of the script, specifically to determine whether to include lines from the input script in the output script. As the script processes each line of the input script, if the current line contains the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` command, `has_no_wf` is set to 0, indicating that the workflow creation section has been found. The script then breaks out of the loop, stopping further inclusion of lines from the input script into the output script. However, the script still appends the workflow creation script obtained from `get_workflow_creation_from_script` to the output script, regardless of the value of `has_no_wf`. If the script never finds the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` command (i.e., `has_no_wf` remains 1), the output script will not include any lines from the input script, effectively creating an empty output script.

**Question:** What specific patterns does the `print_error_logs` function look for in log files to identify errors?

**Answer:** The `print_error_logs` function looks for specific patterns such as:

- TASK-EXIT-CODE: followed by a number indicating an exit code
- Segmentation violation
- Segmentation fault
- Program crashed
- Exception caught
- [FATAL]
- Uncaught exception
- A number in parentheses indicating an exit code
- fair::FatalException

These patterns are used to identify potential errors in the log files.

**Question:** What will be the value of `hash_base` if there are unstaged changes but no `ALIBUILD_HEAD_HASH` or `O2DPG_TEST_HASH_BASE` is set?

**Answer:** hash_base="HEAD"

**Question:** What are the default values for `O2DPG_TEST_HASH_BASE` and `O2DPG_TEST_HASH_HEAD` environment variables if they are not set?

**Answer:** The default values for `O2DPG_TEST_HASH_BASE` and `O2DPG_TEST_HASH_HEAD` environment variables, if they are not set, are "HEAD~1" and "HEAD" respectively.
