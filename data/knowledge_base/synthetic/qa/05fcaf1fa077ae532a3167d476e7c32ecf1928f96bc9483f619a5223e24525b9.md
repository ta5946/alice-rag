**Question:** What is the purpose of the `plot_regex` parameter in the `plot_overlays_root` function, and how does it affect the objects plotted?

**Answer:** The `plot_regex` parameter in the `plot_overlays_root` function serves as a filter for object names. It allows the user to specify a regular expression pattern that object names must match in order to be included in the plot. If `plot_regex` is provided and an object's name does not match the specified regular expression pattern, that object will be excluded from the plotting process. This provides flexibility in selectively plotting certain objects based on their names, which can be useful for focusing on specific types or subsets of objects within the analysis.

**Question:** What happens to the `metric_legend_entries` if a `result` is `None` during the iteration through `metrics` and `results`?

**Answer:** If a `result` is `None` during the iteration through `metrics` and `results`, the iteration simply skips that particular entry without adding any information to `metric_legend_entries`.

**Question:** What actions are taken if the histogram `h1` is neither a 2D nor a 3D histogram?

**Answer:** If the histogram `h1` is neither a 2D nor a 3D histogram, the following actions are taken:
- The `plot_func` is set to `plot_single_overlay_1d`.
- The `metrics_box` fill style is set to 0.
- The histograms `h1` and `h2` are styled using the `style_histograms` function.
- A legend with labels `label1` and `label2` is created and appended to `more_objects`.
- The legend is configured with a fill style of 0, border size of 0, font 43, and text size 20.

**Question:** What conditions determine whether a log plot should be used, and how are the y-axis limits adjusted if a log plot is decided upon?

**Answer:** The decision to use a log plot is based on the ratio of the integral of the histogram (h) to a reference integral (integralRef). Specifically, a log plot should be used if either of these conditions is met:

- The reference integral (integralRef) is greater than 0 and the current integral divided by the reference integral is greater than 100.
- The current integral is greater than 0 and the reference integral divided by the current integral is greater than 100.

If a log plot is decided upon, the y-axis limits are adjusted as follows:

- The margin is calculated as the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of maxY to minY.
- The new minY is set to minY divided by 10 raised to the power of 0.1 times the margin.
- The new maxY is set to maxY multiplied by 10 raised to the power of 0.3 times the margin.

If a log plot is not decided upon, the y-axis limits are adjusted by:

- Calculating a margin as 20% of the difference between maxY and minY.
- Increasing maxY by 3 times the margin.
- Decreasing minY by the maximum of 0 and the margin.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `gSystem.RedirectOutput` function calls in the `plot_overlays_root_no_rel_val` function, and what files are opened for reading?

**Answer:** The `gSystem.RedirectOutput` function calls in the `plot_overlays_root_no_rel_val` function are used to manage the output redirection for logging purposes. The first call opens a log file named "overlay_plotting.log" in the specified output directory, redirecting any subsequent output to this file. The second call resets the output redirection to the standard output.

The function opens the files specified in the `file_configs` list for reading. Each entry in `file_configs` contains a dictionary with keys "path", "label", and "objects". The "path" key is used to open a TFile object with the specified path in read mode.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `gSystem.RedirectOutput(c_char_p(0))` line in the context of this code snippet?

**Answer:** The `gSystem.RedirectOutput(c_char_p(0))` line in this context is used to redirect the output of ROOT system calls to null, effectively silencing any output that would normally be printed to the console. This is particularly useful when executing the `plot_func` that depends on ROOT for plotting histograms and ensuring that no unnecessary output interferes with the operation or clarity of the script.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `nominalFrame` and `logY` variables returned by the `make_frame` function in the `nominalPad.cd()` block?

**Answer:** The `nominalFrame` and `logY` variables returned by the `make_frame` function in the `nominalPad.cd()` block serve to create a coordinate frame for the histogram to be plotted in the `nominalPad` canvas and to determine if a logarithmic scale should be used for the Y-axis. Specifically, `nominalFrame` likely defines the range and labels for the Y-axis, while `logY` indicates whether the Y-axis should be displayed on a logarithmic scale.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `adjust_axis_text` function calls in the given code snippet, and how do they affect the axis labels?

**Answer:** The `adjust_axis_text` function calls in the given code snippet are used to set the axis label text size. Specifically, they adjust the size of the labels on the x-axis and y-axis of the primary and ratio plots. By calling `adjust_axis_text` with arguments `20, 20`, the function sets the text size of the axis labels to 20 for both the x-axis and y-axis in various plots. This ensures consistent and readable label sizes across different axes and frames within the plot, enhancing the overall readability and clarity of the visualized data.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `plot_func` variable and how does it determine the type of plot to be created?

**Answer:** The `plot_func` variable is used to determine the type of plot to be created based on the nature of the histograms. If the first histogram in the `histograms` list is an instance of `TH2` or `TH3`, indicating a 2D or 3D histogram, then `plot_func` is set to `plot_single_overlay_2d` or `plot_single_overlay_3d`. Otherwise, if the histograms are 1D, `plot_func` is set to `plot_single_overlay_1d`.

In the provided code, when `plot_func` is set to `plot_single_overlay_1d`, the histograms are styled using the `style_histograms` function, and a legend is created with the `TLegend` class to display the histogram labels. The legend is configured with specific settings for font, size, and borders.

**Question:** What is the range of non-empty bins for a 1D histogram, and how is it determined in the `findRangeNotEmpty1D` function?

**Answer:** The range of non-empty bins for a 1D histogram is determined by the `findRangeNotEmpty1D` function as follows:

1. It retrieves the X-axis of the histogram using `histogram.GetXaxis()`.
2. It gets the low edge of the first bin with `axis.GetBinLowEdge(1)`, which represents the minimum X value where the histogram has non-zero content.
3. It calculates the upper edge of the last bin with `axis.GetBinUpEdge(axis.GetNbins())`, which represents the maximum X value where the histogram has non-zero content.

These two values, `minX` and `maxX`, define the range of non-empty bins for the 1D histogram.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `ratios` list and how are the elements within it constructed?

**Answer:** The `ratios` list is used to store the ratio histograms that are created by dividing each histogram in the `histograms` list (starting from the second one) by the first histogram in the list. Each element in the `ratios` list is constructed as follows:

1. A new histogram object is created by cloning the current histogram (`h`) being processed.
2. The `SetDirectory(0)` method is called to ensure the histogram is not written to a file.
3. The title of the cloned histogram is updated to include the label of the current histogram being processed and a division by the first histogram's label.
4. The `SetStats(0)` method is called to disable statistics boxes.
5. The `Divide` method is used to perform the division of the current histogram by the first histogram, creating the ratio.
6. The original histogram (`h`) is also set to have no statistics box and its title is updated to include the label of the current histogram being processed.

These ratio histograms are then used for subsequent drawing in the canvas, allowing for comparison between the different histograms relative to the first one.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `findRangeNotEmpty1D` function in the context of the given code snippet?

**Answer:** The `findRangeNotEmpty1D` function is designed to determine the non-zero range of a 1D histogram. Specifically, it identifies the first and last non-empty bins in the histogram by scanning from left to right and then from right to left. This process helps in defining the actual range of data present in the histogram, excluding any leading or trailing empty bins. This range is then used to set the axis limits for the plot, ensuring that the visualization accurately reflects the data distribution.
