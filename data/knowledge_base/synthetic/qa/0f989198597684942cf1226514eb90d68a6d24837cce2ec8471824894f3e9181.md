**Question:** What is the impact of using the `QC_REDIRECT_MERGER_TO_LOCALHOST=1` option on the communication channels during local testing?

**Answer:** During local testing, using the `QC_REDIRECT_MERGER_TO_LOCALHOST=1` option impacts the communication channels by redirecting all messages intended for remote QC mergers to `localhost`. This ensures that data and messages that would normally be sent to remote machines are instead handled locally, allowing the testing to occur without the need to send data externally. The use of `pub/sub` channels makes this redirection non-blocking, meaning that the workflow can proceed without being held up by the redirection process.

**Question:** What is the impact of running the tool in `DD` mode on the StfBuilder, and how should the SHM size be specified?

**Answer:** In `DD` mode, the SHM size for the StfBuilder must be specified in MB, not bytes. This requirement ensures the StfBuilder has sufficient shared memory to operate correctly in distributed mode. The SHM size should be provided using the `DDSHMSIZE` environment variable.

**Question:** What are the differences between the `synchronous-workflow` and `synchronous-workflow-1numa` in terms of GPU and NUMA domain usage?

**Answer:** The `synchronous-workflow` utilizes 8 GPUs and operates across 2 NUMA domains, whereas the `synchronous-workflow-1numa` employs only 4 GPUs without NUMA domain pinning.

**Question:** What are the specific steps required to use the DD mode for processing a few local files, and why is the TF mode necessary in this case?

**Answer:** To process a few local files using the DD mode, the TF mode is necessary because DD mode does not support a list of local files as input. Instead, one should use the TF mode, which allows a comma-separated list of files. This is achieved by providing a comma-separated list of file names as the second argument in the command.
