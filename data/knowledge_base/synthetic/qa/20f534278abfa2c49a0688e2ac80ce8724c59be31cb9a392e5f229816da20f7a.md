**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` commands in this script, and how do they ensure that the JSON file is updated correctly?

**Answer:** The `sed` commands in this script are used to replace placeholders within the JSON file specified by `$QC_JSON_FROM_OUTSIDE` with actual values from the script environment. Specifically, they replace 'REPLACE_ME_RUNNUMBER' with the value of the `RUNNUMBER` variable, 'REPLACE_ME_PASS' with the value of the `PASS` variable, and 'REPLACE_ME_PERIOD' with the value of the `PERIOD` variable.

To ensure the JSON file is updated correctly, the `sed -i` command is utilized to perform in-place edits of the file. This means that the original file is modified directly, with the specified replacements made throughout its content. The `s/old_string/new_string/g` syntax in `sed` stands for substitution, where all occurrences of `old_string` are globally replaced with `new_string`. Thus, this approach allows the script to dynamically update the JSON file based on the current values of the run number, pass, and period, ensuring that the JSON file reflects the correct metadata for the analysis being performed.
