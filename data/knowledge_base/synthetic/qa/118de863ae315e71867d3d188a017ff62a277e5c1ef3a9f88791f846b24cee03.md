**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--disable-root-output` argument in the o2-tof-reco-workflow command?

**Answer:** The `--disable-root-output` argument in the o2-tof-reco-workflow command is used to prevent the generation of ROOT output files. This can help reduce disk I/O and storage requirements, making the processing pipeline more efficient, especially when dealing with large data volumes.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in the script and how does it transform the `WORKFLOW` variable?

**Answer:** The `sed` command is used to format the `WORKFLOW` variable so that each element is on a separate line, making it easier to read and understand when the `print` mode is selected. Specifically, the `sed "s/| */|\n/g"` part of the command searches for occurrences of `| ` (pipe followed by a space) and replaces them with `|` followed by a newline character (`\n`). This transformation takes the original string stored in `WORKFLOW` and splits it into multiple lines, each starting with a `|`, thereby presenting a structured and readable output when the script operates in `print` mode.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `PROXY_OUTSPEC` variable and what type of data does it specify?

**Answer:** The `PROXY_OUTSPEC` variable is used to define the output data specification for the proxy. It specifies that the output data should include `diagWords` from the `TOF/DIAFREQ` collection. This indicates that the proxy is expected to produce diagnostic words related to the frequency of events or data collection from the TOF (Time of Flight) detector.
