**Question:** What is the value of the `ALIEN_JDL_CPULIMIT` variable and what could be the potential impact of changing this value for a different MC production?

**Answer:** The value of the `ALIEN_JDL_CPULIMIT` variable is 8. Changing this value for a different MC production could impact the resource allocation and job execution time on the grid. A higher CPU limit might allow for longer or more intensive jobs to run, potentially increasing the chance of successful job completions, especially for complex simulations. Conversely, a lower CPU limit might result in more jobs being killed due to time-outs, or may not provide sufficient resources to complete the simulation tasks within the allocated time, leading to potential failures.
