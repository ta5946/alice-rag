**Question:** What could be the reason for unresolved symbol problems if AliRoot is loaded before O2 in the given sequence?

**Answer:** If AliRoot is loaded before O2 in the given sequence, it might lead to unresolved symbol problems because the required components or libraries provided by O2 are not yet available. When AliRoot attempts to use symbols or functions from O2, these symbols are undefined since O2 has not been loaded, causing linking errors or unresolved symbol issues during the execution of the simulation.

**Question:** What specific method in the AliRoot_AMPT class can be used to set a random event plane before event generation?

**Answer:** The specific method in the AliRoot_AMPT class that can be used to set a random event plane before event generation is not explicitly detailed in the provided documentation. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that there is a method within the AliRoot_AMPT class designed for this purpose, likely related to setting up the event plane generation or configuration.
