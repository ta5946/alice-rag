**Question:** What is the purpose of the `JQ_COMMAND` variable and what does it accomplish in the script?

**Answer:** The `JQ_COMMAND` variable in the script is designed to manipulate a JSON file to add or update a count of HepMC events for a specified transformation frame (tf) if it doesn't already exist. It accomplishes this by using `jq`, a powerful command-line JSON processor. Here is a detailed breakdown of its function:

1. **File Check**: It first checks if the JSON file (`HepMC_EventSkip_ALT.json` or the one specified by the first argument) exists. If the file does not exist, it creates an empty JSON array.

2. **Condition Check**: The command uses `jq` to check if any of the existing entries in the JSON file have the same transformation frame (`tf`) value as the one being inserted.

3. **Update or Insert**: 
   - If an entry for the specified `tf` already exists, it updates the "HepMCEventCount" field with the new value.
   - If no entry exists for that `tf`, it inserts a new entry containing the `tf` and the "HepMCEventCount" with the value of the event count retrieved from the log file.

4. **Temporary File Creation**: The result of the `jq` command is temporarily stored in a file named `tmp_123.json`.

5. **File Overwrite**: Finally, the temporary file is renamed to the original JSON file name, effectively overwriting the original JSON file with the updated or new information.

This process ensures that the JSON file maintains an accurate record of the HepMC event counts for each transformation frame, either by updating existing records or inserting new ones as necessary.
