**Question:** What is the effect of using the "--skipModules ZDC" option in the workflow configuration?

**Answer:** The "--skipModules ZDC" option in the workflow configuration instructs the simulation to exclude the ZDC (Zero-Degree Calorimeter) module from running. This means that the ZDC detector components and their associated simulations will not be part of the event generation process, potentially streamlining the simulation for scenarios where ZDC data is not needed or where the focus is on other detectors.
