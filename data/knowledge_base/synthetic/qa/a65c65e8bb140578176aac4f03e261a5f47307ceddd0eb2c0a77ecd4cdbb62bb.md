**Question:** What would be the effect of setting the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` variable to only `FT0` and removing `FV0` from both `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC`?

**Answer:** Setting the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` variable to only `FT0` and removing `FV0` from both `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC` would cause the simulation to run only the reconstruction for the FT0 detector and perform quality checks for the FT0 detector, but not for the FV0 detector. This means that the FV0 detector's data will not be reconstructed or checked for quality, and the simulation will focus solely on processing and analyzing the data from the FT0 detector.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `OUTPUT_FILE_NAME` variable in this script, and what file is it set to generate?

**Answer:** The `OUTPUT_FILE_NAME` variable in this script is set to generate the file `topologies/ft0-fv0-digits-qc-ctf.xml`. This file is an XML topology used for the ALICE O2 simulation, specifically for configuring the raw decoders, CTF encoders, and other related processes.

**Question:** What is the default value for the number of EPN compute nodes to use, and how can it be overridden?

**Answer:** The default number of EPN compute nodes to use is specified in the description library file. This default value can be overridden by setting the environment variable RECO_NUM_NODES_OVERRIDE to a non-zero value.

**Question:** What is the purpose of setting the `GEN_TOPO_HASH` and `GEN_TOPO_SOURCE` variables in the context of the O2DataProcessing repository?

**Answer:** The purpose of setting the `GEN_TOPO_HASH` and `GEN_TOPO_SOURCE` variables is to specify how and from which version the O2DataProcessing repository should be fetched. Specifically, `GEN_TOPO_HASH` is set to 1, indicating that the repository should be obtained using a git hash, and `GEN_TOPO_SOURCE` is set to v1.3, which is the git hash or tag from which the repository will be fetched for the Workflow Repository.
