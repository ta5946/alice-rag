**Question:** What is the purpose of the `gen_topo.sh` script in this configuration?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `gen_topo.sh` script in this configuration is to generate an XML topology file named `fdd-digits-qc-ctf.xml` located at `$HOME/topologies`. This script scales the number of raw decoders, CTF encoders, and other processes by the specified factors and then runs the `gen_topo.sh` command to produce the topology file. If the command executes successfully, it outputs a confirmation message indicating that the XML topology has been generated.

**Question:** What would be the impact on the workflow if the RECO_NUM_NODES_OVERRIDE is set to a non-zero value?

**Answer:** Setting RECO_NUM_NODES_OVERRIDE to a non-zero value will override the default number of EPN compute nodes that are specified in the description library file. This allows for customization of the number of nodes used in the workflow, potentially optimizing resource allocation based on specific requirements or constraints.

**Question:** What are the possible values for the `DDMODE` variable and what do they represent in the context of data distribution for the O2DataProcessing repository?

**Answer:** The possible values for the `DDMODE` variable are processing, disk, processing-disk, and discard. In the context of data distribution for the O2DataProcessing repository:

- processing: Data is distributed for processing purposes.
- disk: Data is stored on disk for retrieval.
- processing-disk: Data is both distributed for processing and stored on disk.
- discard: Data is not retained and discarded after processing.
