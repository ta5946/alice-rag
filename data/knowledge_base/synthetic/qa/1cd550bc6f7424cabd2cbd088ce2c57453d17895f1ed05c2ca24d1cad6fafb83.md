**Question:** What is the value of the `NTIMEFRAMES` variable in the steering script, and what does it control in the context of the simulation?

**Answer:** The value of the `NTIMEFRAMES` variable in the steering script is 1. This variable controls the number of time frames in the context of the simulation, indicating that only one time frame will be used for the simulation run.

**Question:** What are the steps included in the central anchor steering script as described in the document?

**Answer:** The central anchor steering script included in the document encompasses the following steps:

- Deriving the timestamp
- Deriving the interaction rate
- Extracting and preparing configurations, which involve identifying the detectors included in the run
- Executing the simulation process
- Performing Quality Control (QC) checks
