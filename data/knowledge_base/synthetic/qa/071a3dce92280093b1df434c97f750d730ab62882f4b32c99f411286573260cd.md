**Question:** What is the purpose of the `get_prs` function and how does it filter the pull requests based on the `pr_state` parameter?

**Answer:** The `get_prs` function is designed to retrieve pull requests (PRs) from a specified GitHub repository based on certain criteria. It filters PRs based on the `pr_state` parameter, which allows the function to narrow down the results to either 'open', 'closed', or 'merged' PRs. If `pr_state` is provided, it is appended to the API request URL in the format `state=<pr_state>`. For instance, if `pr_state` is set to 'closed', the function will fetch only closed PRs from the repository. If `pr_state` is not provided, the function will fetch both open and closed PRs by setting `state=all`.

**Question:** What information is included in the rows appended to `rows_per_label[label]` for each label, and how is the `mc_data` field determined?

**Answer:** The rows appended to `rows_per_label[label]` include the following information:

- User login
- Repository name
- Pull Request link
- Pull Request title
- Pull Request state
- Merged status
- MC and DATA label(s)

The `mc_data` field is determined as follows:
- If `mc_data` is provided, it is joined into a comma-separated string.
- If no specific `mc_data` is provided, it defaults to 'MC,DATA'.

**Question:** How does the script handle the case when no pull requests are found with the specified labels?

**Answer:** The script checks if the retrieved pull requests list `prs` is empty. If no pull requests are found, it prints the message '==> There are no PRs to report.' and exits with a status code of 0.

**Question:** What is the default value of the `--per-page` argument and what does it represent in the context of retrieving pull requests?

**Answer:** The default value of the `--per-page` argument is 100. This represents the number of results per page when retrieving pull requests from the GitHub repository.

**Question:** What is the purpose of sorting the merged PRs by their merged timestamp and how is this sorting implemented?

**Answer:** The purpose of sorting the merged PRs by their merged timestamp is to order the pull requests based on when they were merged, from the earliest to the latest merge time. This sorting is implemented by first collecting the merged PRs and their merge timestamps into lists. Then, the merged PRs are sorted using the `sorted` function with a custom key, where the key is formed by pairing each PR with its corresponding merge timestamp from the `merged_at` list. The `zip` function is used to combine the two lists into a list of pairs, which is then passed to the `sorted` function. The sorted pairs are unpacked back into the `prs_merged` list, ensuring the PRs are in chronological order of their merge timestamps.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `common_header` variable in the `make_report` function, and what does it contain?

**Answer:** The `common_header` variable in the `make_report` function serves as a standard header for each table generated in the report. It contains a markdown table definition with column headers for Requestor, Package, PR, PR title, State, Merged at, and Data or MC.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `labels_take` list in the given code snippet, and how is it used?

**Answer:** The `labels_take` list in the code snippet is used to collect the labels for which the table should consider a particular pull request (PR). This list is populated as part of the loop that iterates over the pull requests, with the intention of determining which PRs should be included in the table based on their associated labels. However, the specific usage of this list is not detailed in the provided code snippet; it is implied that after collecting the relevant labels, they will be used to filter or include PRs in some manner, likely for generating a table or report.

**Question:** What is the default value of the `--label-accepted-suffix` argument, and what is the expected format of an accepted label based on this value?

**Answer:** The default value of the `--label-accepted-suffix` argument is 'accepted'. An accepted label is expected to have the form `<request-label>-<accepted-suffix>`, so based on the default value, an accepted label would look like `<request-label>-accepted`.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `organise_prs` function and how does it categorize the pull requests?

**Answer:** The `organise_prs` function is designed to categorize pull requests (PRs) from a GitHub repository into four distinct categories based on their status: merged, simply closed, and open. It then sorts the merged PRs by the time they were merged, from the oldest to the most recent. Here's a breakdown of how it categorizes the pull requests:

1. **Merged PRs**:
   - These are collected in the `prs_merged` list.
   - The corresponding merge times are collected in the `merged_at` list.

2. **Closed PRs**:
   - These are categorized as either simply closed or open.
   - Simply closed PRs are collected in the `prs_closed` list.
   - The times when these PRs were closed are collected in the `closed_updated_at` list.
   - Open PRs that are closed but not yet merged are collected in the `prs_open` list.
   - The times when these open PRs were last updated are collected in the `open_updated_at` list.

By organizing the PRs in this manner, the function facilitates easier tracking and prioritization of which pull requests should be ported or further reviewed, particularly by sorting the merged PRs chronologically.

**Question:** What does the function `separate_labels_request_accept` do when `accept_suffix` is not provided?

**Answer:** When the `accept_suffix` is not provided, all labels are considered request labels and no labels are classified as accepted labels.

---

**Question:** What condition ensures that a pull request (PR) is included in the report based on its labels?

**Answer:** A pull request (PR) is included in the report based on its labels if it meets the following conditions:
1. It contains at least one label that is in the `labels_request` list.
2. This label is either 'mc' or 'data', and the PR has the corresponding assigned label.
3. If `label_accept_suffix` is not `None` and there is no label in the PR that matches the format of the requested label followed by the suffix (e.g., `label_name-label_accept_suffix`), the PR is still included in the report if the requested label is the only relevant one found.
4. The PR must have at least one label that is of interest to the report. If no such label is found after checking all the conditions, the PR is excluded from the report.

**Question:** What happens if the request to the GitHub API is not successful (i.e., the status code is not 200)?

**Answer:** If the request to the GitHub API is not successful (i.e., the status code is not 200), the code will print an error message indicating the status code and the text of the response, like this: 'Failed to retrieve data: [status_code] - [response.text]'. Furthermore, the variable 'has_error' is set to True, and the loop is exited using 'break'.
