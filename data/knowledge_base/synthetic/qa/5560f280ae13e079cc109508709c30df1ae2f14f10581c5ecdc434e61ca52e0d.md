**Question:** What is the purpose of the `PROXY_INSPEC` variable in the workflow configuration?

**Answer:** The `PROXY_INSPEC` variable in the workflow configuration is used to specify the data specification for the TOF diagnostic input proxy. It defines the type of data to be acquired, which in this case is "diagWords" from the TOF/DIAFREQ folder, specifically the first channel. Additionally, it includes a wildcard pattern `eos:***/INFORMATION` to indicate that the data should be retrieved from the EOS system, searching for files in any subdirectory under the specified root directory that contain the word "INFORMATION" in their path.
