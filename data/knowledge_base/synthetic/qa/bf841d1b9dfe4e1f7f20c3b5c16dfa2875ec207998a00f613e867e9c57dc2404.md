**Question:** What is the purpose of using `sed` in the given workflow command, and how does it transform the input?

**Answer:** The `sed` command in the workflow command is used to process the `${WORKFLOW}` variable for output formatting. Specifically, it performs two transformations:

1. It replaces all instances of `\\n` with a newline character `\n`. This is useful for converting escaped newline characters in the input into actual newlines, making the workflow command output more readable and properly formatted.

2. It replaces all instances of `| *` with `| \n`. This transformation ensures that any pipes followed by spaces in the workflow command are separated by newlines, which can be beneficial for readability and parsing.

Overall, these transformations make the `${WORKFLOW}` variable's content more human-readable and easier to process in subsequent steps of the workflow.

**Question:** What are the specific arguments used for the `o2-tpc-merge-integrate-cluster-workflow` step in the workflow, and what is the purpose of the `--max-delay` parameter?

**Answer:** The specific arguments used for the `o2-tpc-merge-integrate-cluster-workflow` step in the workflow are:

- `--dump-calib-data`: This is used to dump calibration data.
- `--meta-output-dir none`: This sets the metadata output directory to none.
- `--process-3D-currents true`: This indicates that 3D currents should be processed.
- `--nthreads 8`: This sets the number of threads to 8.
- `--enableWritingPadStatusMap true`: This enables writing of the pad status map.
- `--max-delay 1`: This sets the maximum delay to 1.

The purpose of the `--max-delay` parameter is to specify the maximum delay in the processing pipeline, which can be crucial for synchronizing data acquisition and processing stages, ensuring that no data is lost due to timing issues.
