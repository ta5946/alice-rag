**Question:** What specific trigger is used in the simulation for heavy ion collisions, and how is it configured?

**Answer:** The specific trigger used in the simulation for heavy ion collisions is a simple impact parameter selection. This trigger configuration is directly specified in the trigger macro provided in the simulation setup, without further detailed configuration within the document beyond this basic description.

**Question:** What does the command line option `-h` do when passed to the script?

**Answer:** The `-h` or `--help` option, when passed to the script, triggers the display of help information and then exits the script. Specifically, it calls `usage; o2-sim --help full ; exit 0` which provides a full help output of the o2-sim command.
