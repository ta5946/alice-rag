**Question:** What happens if neither O2DPG nor O2 is loaded when running the ALICE HEPscore benchmark workflow?

**Answer:** If neither O2DPG nor O2 is loaded when running the ALICE HEPscore benchmark workflow, the script will output the following error messages and then exit:

```
Error: This needs O2DPG loaded
Error: This needs O2 loaded
```

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `ALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE` environment variable in the context of this script?

**Answer:** The `ALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE` environment variable is used to specify the location of a local cache for the CCDB (Common Control Database). In the script, if a local CCDB cache directory (`${HEPSCORE_CCDB_ROOT}/.ccdb`) is available, this variable is set to point to that directory. This allows the script to use pre-fetched CCDB objects from this local cache, potentially speeding up the workflow execution. If no local cache is available, the variable is set to a cache directory in the current working directory (`${PWD}/.ccdb`), enabling the script to fetch objects from the CCDB server and cache them locally for future use.

**Question:** What is the value of the `SIMENGINE` variable and what does it represent in this simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The value of the `SIMENGINE` variable is `TGeant4`. In this simulation workflow, `SIMENGINE` represents the simulation engine used for event generation, which in this case is Geant4.
