**Question:** What command is used to extract the path to the stdout file and the name of the failed task from the grep output?

**Answer:** The command used to extract the path to the stdout file and the name of the failed task from the grep output is:

For the stdout file path:
```bash
stdoutpath=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $1}')
```

For the failed task name:
```bash
logfile=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $2}')
```

**Question:** What specific commands are used to extract logs related to simulation tasks, and how do they differ from the command used to extract the general log archive?

**Answer:** To extract logs related to simulation tasks, the command `mytar -xvzf debug_log_archive.tgz --wildcards "*${tf}*serverlog*"`, `mytar -xvzf debug_log_archive.tgz --wildcards "*${tf}*workerlog*`, and `mytar -xvzf debug_log_archive.tgz --wildcards "*${tf}*mergerlog*` are used. These commands differ from the command used to extract the general log archive in that the general log is extracted with `unzip -n log_archive.zip`, which uses the unzip utility, whereas the simulation logs are extracted using `mytar` with the `--wildcards` option to match specific file names containing the timeframe `tf`.

For the general log, the process is straightforward:
```bash
unzip -n log_archive.zip
```
This command simply unzips the log archive without any additional filters.

In contrast, the extraction of simulation-related logs is more nuanced:
```bash
mytar -xvzf debug_log_archive.tgz --wildcards "*${tf}*serverlog*"
mytar -xvzf debug_log_archive.tgz --wildcards "*${tf}*workerlog*"
mytar -xvzf debug_log_archive.tgz --wildcards "*${tf}*mergerlog*"
```
These commands use `mytar` to extract files from the tar archive `debug_log_archive.tgz` that match the specified wildcards. The `--wildcards` option allows for more precise matching of file names, ensuring only logs related to the specific simulation tasks (serverlog, workerlog, mergerlog) and the extracted timeframe are extracted.
