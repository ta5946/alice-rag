**Question:** What is the purpose of the `external` generator in the simulation configuration file `sim.ini` used in this script?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `external` generator in the simulation configuration file `sim.ini` is to add custom information to the event header during the event generation process. This external generator is specified in the command line with the `-g external` option, which instructs the simulation to use this generator to modify the standard event data, potentially enriching it with additional details or analyses before the events are processed by the simulation modules.
