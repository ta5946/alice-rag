**Question:** What is the purpose of the `transportPrimaryFuncName` setting in the `[Stack]` section and how is it used in the simulation?

**Answer:** The `transportPrimaryFuncName` setting in the `[Stack]` section specifies the function that defines the selective particle transport criteria. In the provided example, this function is called `transportPDG(321)`, which is defined in the macro file `transportPDG.macro`. This function is used to determine which particles should be transported through the detector geometry, according to the specific settings defined in the `transportPDG.macro` file. When `transportPrimary=external` is set, the simulation uses the external function defined by `transportPrimaryFuncName` to selectively transport particles, based on the criteria defined in the associated macro file.
