**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--inject-missing-data` flag in the o2-dpl-raw-proxy command?

**Answer:** The `--inject-missing-data` flag in the o2-dpl-raw-proxy command is used to handle cases where some data might be missing or not fully available. This flag ensures that the processing pipeline can proceed even if certain expected data points are not present, by providing placeholder or default values where data is missing.
