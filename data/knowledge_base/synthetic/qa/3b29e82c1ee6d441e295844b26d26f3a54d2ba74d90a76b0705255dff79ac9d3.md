**Question:** What additional workflow component is added if the QC parameter is set in the configuration, and how is it specified?

**Answer:** If the QC parameter is set in the configuration, an additional workflow component named "QC" is added. This component is specified using the configuration file path stored in the QC_CONFIG variable, which is "/o2/components/qc/ANY/any/phs-led-qc". This is achieved by the line `add_QC_from_consul "${QC_CONFIG}"` in the workflow assembly process.
