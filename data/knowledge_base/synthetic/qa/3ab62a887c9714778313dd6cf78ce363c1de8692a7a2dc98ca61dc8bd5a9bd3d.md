**Question:** What would happen if the `--relative-cpu` argument is not provided when running the simulation?

**Answer:** If the `--relative-cpu` argument is not provided when running the simulation, the default value for the relative fraction of maximum number of available workers will be used. This default value is not specified in the given document, so it would depend on the implementation details not covered here.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `extend` function in the script, and how does it handle the configuration of the workflows?

**Answer:** The `extend` function in the script is designed to merge the configuration of one workflow into another. It retains the overall configuration from the original workflow while incorporating the tasks and elements from the second workflow. This is achieved by loading the original and extending workflows using the `read_workflow` function. The original workflow is then extended with the contents of the second workflow. Finally, the updated workflow is saved to a new file, with metadata from the original workflow being propagated to the output.

**Question:** What happens if the specified task does not exist in the workflow when using the `--task` flag?

**Answer:** If the specified task does not exist in the workflow when using the `--task` flag, the script will print a message indicating that the task with the specified name was not found, and then exit with a status code of 1.

**Question:** What is the default output file name when using the "merge" command to extend a workflow?

**Answer:** The default output file name when using the "merge" command to extend a workflow is "workflow_merged.json".

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `update_workflow_resource_requirements` function and how does it interact with the `nworkers` function?

**Answer:** The `update_workflow_resource_requirements` function modifies the resource requirements for the tasks within a workflow, specifically adjusting the number of workers based on the argument provided. In the `nworkers` function, this utility is called to update the resource requirements of the workflow before it is saved. The `nworkers` function takes an `args.jobs` argument, which specifies the number of workers to set for the workflow. This interaction allows the `nworkers` function to dynamically adjust the resource allocation for the workflow, ensuring that it meets the specified job count.

**Question:** What modifications can be made to a task using the "modify" command, and what are the associated arguments for these modifications?

**Answer:** The "modify" command allows for several modifications to a task within the workflow file. The associated arguments for these modifications are:

- `--needs` (nargs="+"): Specifies the required tasks that need to be executed before the target task.
- `--timeframe` (type=int): Sets the timeframe for the task.
- `--cwd` (help="current working directory"): Defines the current working directory for the task.
- `--labels` (nargs="+"): Attaches labels to the task.
- `--cpu` (type=int): Determines the absolute number of workers to be used for the task.

Note that changing the name of the task is not currently supported, as it would also affect the log-file name.

**Question:** What will happen if the `args.add_task` flag is set to `True` and the specified workflow file already exists?

**Answer:** If the `args.add_task` flag is set to `True` and the specified workflow file already exists, the workflow will be read, a new task with the specified name will be added to it, and then the updated workflow will be saved back to the file.

---

**Question:** What does the `--check` argument do when used with the `inspect` command?

**Answer:** When the `--check` argument is used with the `inspect` command, it checks the sanity of the specified workflow file.

---

**Question:** What are the required arguments for the "nworkers" sub-command and what are their purposes?

**Answer:** The required arguments for the "nworkers" sub-command are:

1. "file": This argument is used to specify the workflow file that needs to be modified.

2. "jobs": This argument is an integer that represents the number of workers to be recomputed relative to CPU usage.
