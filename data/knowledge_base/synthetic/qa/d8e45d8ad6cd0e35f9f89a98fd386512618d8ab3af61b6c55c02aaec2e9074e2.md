**Question:** What specific command-line arguments and environment variables are required to run the `monitor_fileaccess` tool to monitor file access events for child processes of a specific shell?

**Answer:** To run the `monitor_fileaccess` tool and monitor file access events for child processes of a specific shell, the following command-line arguments and environment variable must be used:

```
sudo MAXMOTHERPID=689584 ./monitor_fileaccess.exe | tee /tmp/fileaccess
