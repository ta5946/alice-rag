**Question:** What is the purpose of using `eval` in the workflow execution section of the script?

**Answer:** In the workflow execution section of the script, `eval` is used to interpret and execute the command string stored in the `WORKFLOW` variable. This allows for the dynamic construction and execution of complex command-line instructions, including any flags or arguments that may have been appended to the `WORKFLOW` variable. By using `eval`, the script can adaptively handle various workflow modes and configurations, ensuring that the correct command is executed based on the specific conditions and inputs provided.
