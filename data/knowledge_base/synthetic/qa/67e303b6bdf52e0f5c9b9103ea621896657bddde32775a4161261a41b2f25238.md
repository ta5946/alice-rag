**Question:** What is the correct command-line argument to use for O2 simulations when integrating the MCStepLogger, and why is it important to use this specific argument?

**Answer:** The correct command-line argument to use for O2 simulations when integrating the MCStepLogger is `o2-sim-serial` instead of `o2-sim`. This is important because `o2-sim-serial` is designed to be compatible with the MCStepLogger, ensuring that the step logging functionality works correctly. Using `o2-sim` would not provide the necessary integration for step logging.

**Question:** What are the specific commands to replace `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_DEBUG=libs`, and `LD_DEBUG=statistics` when running the O2 simulation on macOS?

**Answer:** To replace `LD_PRELOAD` on macOS, use `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`:

```bash
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/Users/laurent/alice/sw/osx_x86-64/O2/latest-clion-o2/lib/libMCStepLogger.dylib MCSTEPLOG_TTREE=1 MCSTEPLOG_OUTFILE=toto.root o2-sim-serial -m MCH -g fwmugen -n 1
```

For `LD_DEBUG=libs`, use `DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1`:

```bash
DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1 MCSTEPLOG_TTREE=1 MCSTEPLOG_OUTFILE=toto.root o2-sim-serial -m MCH -g fwmugen -n 1
```

To replace `LD_DEBUG=statistics`, use `DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS=1`:

```bash
DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS=1 MCSTEPLOG_TTREE=1 MCSTEPLOG_OUTFILE=toto.root o2-sim-serial -m MCH -g fwmugen -n 1
```

**Question:** What does the stepping logger report for the `normalPCB1` volume in terms of secondary particles and total transported tracks?

**Answer:** The stepping logger reports that for the `normalPCB1` volume, there were 3 total transported tracks and 0 secondary particles.
