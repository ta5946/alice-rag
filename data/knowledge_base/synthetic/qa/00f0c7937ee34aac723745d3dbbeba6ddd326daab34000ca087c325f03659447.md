**Question:** What are the potential consequences of running O2DPG MC workloads on hardware with fewer resources than the recommended environment, and how might these issues be mitigated?

**Answer:** Running O2DPG MC workloads on hardware with fewer resources than the recommended environment can lead to problems such as inefficient performance, resource contention, and potential failures. The workflow runner assumes availability of 8 cores, and the digitisation and transport simulation processes are designed to use 8 threads. These requirements may not be met on underpowered hardware, potentially causing the workflow to degrade in performance or fail entirely.

To mitigate these issues, some tuning and adjustment may be necessary. Experts can circumvent certain limitations by using CCDB snapshots instead of fetching objects dynamically. By pre-caching objects as snapshots, the workload can be optimized for systems with limited resources. Additionally, adjusting the number of workers and threads according to the available resources can help in managing the workload more effectively.

**Question:** What are the two main steps in creating and running a MC job according to the document, and how do they decouple configuration logic from execution logic?

**Answer:** The two main steps in creating and running a MC job, according to the document, are:

1. Creating a valid/configured description of a MC job, referred to as "workflow". This step involves using a workﬂow creator to set up a coherent, integrated MC workﬂow in a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) form, described as JSON, which models the dependency of tasks. It also configures the MC workﬂow based on user parameters such as collision system, generators, interaction rate, and number of timeframes.

2. Running the MC job with a dynamic graph scheduler. This step involves using a workﬂow executor to run the configured workﬂow. 

By separating these steps, configuration logic and execution logic are decoupled, allowing for flexibility in how tasks are executed while keeping the setup and configuration of the MC job organized and modular.
