**Question:** What is the range of magnetic fields used in the simulation and how are they specified in the command line?

**Answer:** The range of magnetic fields used in the simulation is between 15.0 and 20.0 Tesla. These values are specified in the command line using the `--configKeyValues` flag, where the function `trigger_impactb_pythia8(${BMIN}, ${BMAX})` is called with the variables ${BMIN} and ${BMAX} set to 15.0 and 20.0, respectively.

**Question:** What specific information about the event is used by the external trigger in this Pythia8 simulation example, and how is it utilized to define the trigger selection?

**Answer:** In this Pythia8 simulation example, the external trigger utilizes information about the impact parameter of the currently-generated heavy-ion event. The trigger selection is defined by setting an acceptance range for the impact parameter, which can be adjusted through command-line parameters. Events with an impact parameter falling within the specified min-max range are accepted by the trigger.
