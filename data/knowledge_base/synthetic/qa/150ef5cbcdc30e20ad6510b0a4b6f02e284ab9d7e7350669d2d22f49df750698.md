**Question:** What is the consequence of not setting the HepMC version to 2 when running the simulation with version 4.0.0?

**Answer:** The consequence of not setting the HepMC version to 2 when running the simulation with version 4.0.0 is that the simulation will not work.

**Question:** What changes are made to the `optns.optns` file when HQ mode is enabled, and what error message is displayed if the EPOS4HQ version is not specified?

**Answer:** When HQ mode is enabled, the following changes are made to the `optns.optns` file:
- If "ihq" already exists, it is changed to `set ihq 1`.
- If "ihq" does not exist, a new line `set ihq 1` is appended to the file.
Additionally, if the EPOS4HQ version is not specified, an error message "Error: EPOS4HQ version not found" is displayed and the script exits with code 7.

The HepMC version is set to 3 when HQ mode is enabled, though this is not directly stated in the provided document but can be inferred as a logical step after enabling HQ mode.

**Question:** What action is taken if the eCM value is not explicitly set in the optns.optns file but the "ecms" line is present?

**Answer:** If the eCM value is not explicitly set but the "ecms" line is present in the optns.optns file, the script will read the eCM value from that line using grep and awk commands and print "Energy set to [eCM value]".

**Question:** What action is taken if the number of events is not explicitly set using the variable NEV?

**Answer:** If the number of events is not explicitly set using the variable NEV, the script checks the optns.optns file for a line containing "nfull". If such a line exists, it extracts the number of events specified by the third field in that line. If the line does not exist, an error message is displayed, indicating that the number of events is not set in the EPOS4 configuration, and the script exits with a status of 5.

**Question:** What action is taken if the specified options file does not exist?

**Answer:** If the specified options file does not exist, an error message is printed to the standard error stream stating "Error: Options file $optns.optns not found" and the script exits with a status code of 4.
