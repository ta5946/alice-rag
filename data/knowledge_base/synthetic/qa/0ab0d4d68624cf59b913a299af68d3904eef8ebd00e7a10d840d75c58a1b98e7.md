## Content

**Question:** What specific utility does the example provide for users who need to obtain HepMC files from Pythia8 events?

**Answer:** The example provides a small utility in the form of an external generator implementation named `Pythia8HepMC3.C` that users can utilize to obtain HepMC files from Pythia8 events. Additionally, it includes a `run.sh` script to demonstrate how to use this external generator and verify its functionality by feeding back the generated HepMC files into the simulation.
