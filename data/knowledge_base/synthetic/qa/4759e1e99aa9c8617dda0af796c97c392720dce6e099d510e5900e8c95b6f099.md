**Question:** What is the purpose of the `add_QC_finalization` function in the given code snippet?

**Answer:** The `add_QC_finalization` function is designed to add a 'remote-batch' part to the standard QC workflows. It accepts parameters such as `taskName` (the name of the QC workflow), `qcConfigPath` (the path to the QC config file), and `needs` (a list of tasks that must be completed before this task). Depending on the `standalone` flag, it adjusts the dependencies for the task. It also creates a new task named using the `QC_finalize_name` function, and specifies the necessary parameters for the task, including the working directory (`qcdir`), labels (`lab`), CPU requirement, and memory allocation.

**Question:** What modifications would you make to the `add_QC_postprocessing` function if you needed to include multiple specific runs instead of a single run?

**Answer:** To modify the `add_QC_postprocessing` function for including multiple specific runs instead of a single run, you would need to adjust the `overrideValues` construction. Specifically, you would change the condition that adds a single run number to include a list of runs. Here's how you could do it:

```python
overrideValues = '--override-values "'
overrideValues += f'qc.config.Activity.number={"|".join(map(str, runsList))};' if runSpecific else 'qc.config.Activity.number=0;';
```

In this modification:
- `runsList` is a list of run numbers you want to include.
- The `map(str, runsList)` converts each run number in the list to a string.
- `|` is used as a delimiter to separate the runs, which is a common approach for specifying multiple values in such configurations.

This change allows the post-processing to cover objects from multiple specific runs as required.

**Question:** What are the required conditions for executing the workflow definition in the script, and what action is taken if the specified qcdir does not exist?

**Answer:** The script requires both O2 and QUALITYCONTROL_ROOT to be loaded. If the qcdir specified does not exist, the script creates it. The workflow is defined by including all QC finalization stages with the specified parameters, and then the workflow stages are dumped to the output file specified by the 'o' argument.

**Question:** What command is executed if the configuration file does not exist in the currently loaded software?

**Answer:** if the configuration file does not exist, the command executed is:

```bash
echo "Task [taskName] not performed due to config file not found"
```

**Question:** Which two QA tasks are configured with the same JSON configuration file, and what is the file path for this configuration?

**Answer:** The two QA tasks configured with the same JSON configuration file are tofdigitsQC and tofDigitsQC, and the file path for this configuration is json://${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/config/QC/json/tofdigits.json

---

**Question:** What is the QC configuration used when neither MCH nor MID nor MFT are active?

**Answer:** The QC configuration used when neither MCH nor MID nor MFT are active is 'json://${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/config/QC/json/pidtofNoTRD.json' for the tofPIDQC task, and 'json://${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/config/QC/json/ft0-reconstruction-config.json' for the RecPointsQC task.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `prodSpecific` variable in the context of the `overrideValues` string construction, and how does it affect the `qc.config.Activity.periodName` configuration?

**Answer:** The `prodSpecific` variable determines whether the `qc.config.Activity.periodName` is set to the value of `productionTag` or left empty. If `prodSpecific` is `True`, the `periodName` will be set to `productionTag`, ensuring that the specific production tag is used for the activity period. If `prodSpecific` is `False`, the `periodName` will be set to an empty string, effectively disabling the specification of a particular production tag for the activity period.

**Question:** Which tasks are added to the finalization sequence if both MCH and MID are active, but MFT is not?

**Answer:** The finalization sequence will include the following tasks if both MCH and MID are active, but MFT is not:
- MCHDigitsTaskQC
- MCHErrorsTaskQC
- MCHRecoTaskQC
- MCHTracksTaskQC
- MCHMIDTracksTaskQC

**Question:** What would happen if both O2DPG_ROOT and O2_ROOT environment variables are not set, according to the script?

**Answer:** If both O2DPG_ROOT and O2_ROOT environment variables are not set, the script would print the following errors:

```
Error: This needs O2DPG loaded
Error: This needs O2 loaded
```

**Question:** Which QC task is configured to analyze PHS cells and clusters, and what is the corresponding JSON configuration file used for this task?

**Answer:** The QC task configured to analyze PHS cells and clusters is 'PHSCellsClustersQC'. The corresponding JSON configuration file used for this task is 'json://${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/config/QC/json/phs-cells-clusters-task.json'.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `runSpecific=False` and `prodSpecific=True` parameters in the `add_QC_postprocessing` function call for the `tofTrendingHits` workflow?

**Answer:** The `runSpecific=False` parameter in the `add_QC_postprocessing` function call for the `tofTrendingHits` workflow indicates that this post-processing step should not be run exclusively for a specific run, but rather it is applicable across multiple runs. On the other hand, the `prodSpecific=True` parameter suggests that this post-processing step is specific to the production environment and might not be relevant for other types of processing or analysis.

**Question:** What is the default value for the shared memory segment size when `bigshm` is not specified in the `getDPL_global_options` function?

**Answer:** The default value for the shared memory segment size when `bigshm` is not specified in the `getDPL_global_options` function is 50000000000.

**Question:** What are the names of the QC tasks that are added for MFT digits processing, and how are they constructed?

**Answer:** The QC tasks added for MFT digits processing are named as follows: mftDigitsQC0_local1, mftDigitsQC0_local2, mftDigitsQC0_local3, mftDigitsQC0_local4, mftDigitsQC1_local1, mftDigitsQC1_local2, mftDigitsQC1_local3, mftDigitsQC1_local4, mftDigitsQC2_local1, mftDigitsQC2_local2, mftDigitsQC2_local3, mftDigitsQC2_local4, mftDigitsQC3_local1, mftDigitsQC3_local2, mftDigitsQC3_local3, mftDigitsQC3_local4, mftDigitsQC4_local1, mftDigitsQC4_local2, mftDigitsQC4_local3, mftDigitsQC4_local4. These names are constructed by appending '_local' followed by the time frame number (ranging from 1 to 4) to the base name 'mftDigitsQC' followed by the segment number (ranging from 0 to 4).
