**Question:** What is the purpose of specifying the `-jmax 1` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command?

**Answer:** The `-jmax 1` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command limits the maximum number of parallel jobs to 1. This means that the workflow will run sequentially rather than concurrently, which can be useful for debugging or when running on a single-core system where multiple processes would interfere with each other.
