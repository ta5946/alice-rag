**Question:** What is the purpose of using the `sed` command in the script and how does it transform the input?

**Answer:** The `sed` command in the script is used to transform the input string by replacing multiple occurrences of space followed by `|` and an optional space with a newline character. This effectively converts a single line with multiple items separated by `|` into multiple lines, each containing a single item. This transformation is useful for making the output more readable, especially when the input contains a series of workflow commands or options separated by `|`.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--inject-missing-data` option in the `o2-dpl-raw-proxy` command?

**Answer:** The `--inject-missing-data` option in the `o2-dpl-raw-proxy` command is used to add missing data to the raw data stream, ensuring that all expected channels and data points are present even if they are not physically recorded. This is particularly useful in scenarios where some data might be missing due to hardware issues or other disruptions, allowing the processing pipeline to proceed without interruption.
