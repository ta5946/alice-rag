**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in this script?

**Answer:** The `sed` command in this script is used to filter the output of the `crmc` command, specifically to ensure that only lines starting with "HepMC::" or "[EAUWVP] " are printed. This filtering helps in isolating the HepMC event record from the rest of the output, which is important for the script's intended purpose of processing only the HepMC event records without writing to standard out, as mandated by the comment at the beginning of the script.
