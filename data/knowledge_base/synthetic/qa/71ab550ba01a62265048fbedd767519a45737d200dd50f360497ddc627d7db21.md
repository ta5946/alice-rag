**Question:** What is the purpose of the `PROXY_OUTSPEC` variable in the context of the ITS calibration scans?

**Answer:** The `PROXY_OUTSPEC` variable in the context of the ITS calibration scans is used to define the output specifications or metadata that will be associated with the calibration results. It specifies various types of information to be recorded, such as the tuning string, run type, fit type, scan type, chip donor string, configuration database version, and pixel type. This information is crucial for documentation and analysis of the calibration scans, ensuring that all relevant details are systematically captured and stored for future reference and validation purposes.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in the script and how does it transform the `WORKFLOW` variable?

**Answer:** The `sed` command is used to transform the `WORKFLOW` variable by replacing occurrences of `| *` with `|` followed by a newline character. This effectively splits the string on `|` followed by zero or more spaces, and then indents each resulting line with a tab. This transformation makes the output more readable when the `WORKFLOWMODE` variable is set to "print".

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--allow-empty-rofs` option in the `o2-itsmft-stf-decoder-workflow` command?

**Answer:** The `--allow-empty-rofs` option in the `o2-itsmft-stf-decoder-workflow` command is used to permit the processing of ROOT files (ROFs) that may be empty, meaning they contain no valid data. This is useful in scenarios where some ROFs might be incomplete or corrupted but the workflow needs to continue processing as many valid ROFs as possible without stopping due to the presence of empty ones.
