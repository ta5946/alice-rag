## Content

**Question:** What changes were made to the repository structure to accommodate the transition from the O2DataProcessing repository to this one?

**Answer:** The repository structure was modified to integrate the content from the former O2DataProcessing repository into a new location. Specifically, the scripts and configurations from O2DataProcessing were moved to a new directory named [DATA](DATA). This change was made to better organize the simulation and data reconstruction scripts for the ALICE experiment within the O2 project. Additionally, documentation for Monte Carlo simulations and data reconstruction was placed in separate directories, [MC/README.md](MC/README.md) and [DATA/README.md](DATA/README.md), to provide clearer guidance on how to use the various resources available in the repository.
