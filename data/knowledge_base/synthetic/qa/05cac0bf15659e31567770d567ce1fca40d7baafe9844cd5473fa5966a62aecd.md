**Question:** What is the effect of the `--skipModules ZDC` flag in the workflow configuration and how does it impact the simulation process?

**Answer:** The `--skipModules ZDC` flag in the workflow configuration is used to exclude the ZDC (Zero Degree Calorimeter) module from the simulation process. By skipping this module, the simulation workflow omits the ZDC detector and its associated functionalities, potentially reducing the complexity and computational requirements of the simulation. This can be useful in scenarios where the ZDC is not necessary for the specific analysis or when focusing on performance optimization by excluding non-critical components.
