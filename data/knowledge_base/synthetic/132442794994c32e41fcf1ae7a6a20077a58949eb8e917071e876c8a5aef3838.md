**Question:** What specific function call is used to retrieve the configuration for the Hijing event generator in the given macro, and what are the parameters of this function?

**Answer:** The specific function call to retrieve the configuration for the Hijing event generator is `hijing(double energy = 5020., double bMin = 0., double bMax = 20.)`. This function is defined in the macro `aliroot_hijing.macro`.

**Question:** What specific sequence of commands must be used to ensure that AliRoot is loaded correctly after O2 when running the Hijing simulation example, and why is this order important?

**Answer:** To ensure that AliRoot is loaded correctly after O2 when running the Hijing simulation example, you must use the following command sequence:
```
alienv enter O2/latest,AliRoot/latest
```
The order is important because loading AliRoot after O2 resolves any potential unresolved symbol issues that may arise. Loading O2 before AliRoot could lead to unresolved symbol problems due to version incompatibilities or other dependencies.
