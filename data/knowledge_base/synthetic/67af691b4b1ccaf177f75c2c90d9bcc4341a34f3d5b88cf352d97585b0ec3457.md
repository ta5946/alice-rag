**Question:** What is the purpose of the `mapShifts` array in this script?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `mapShifts` array in this script is to store key-value pairs where the key is a map identifier and the value is a shift amount. This allows for easy lookup and retrieval of shift values associated with specific maps, facilitating operations that might involve applying or adjusting shifts for different maps within the simulation.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `mapShifts` associative array in the given script, and how might it be used in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation documentation?

**Answer:** The `mapShifts` associative array is declared to store key-value pairs where the keys and values are likely to represent different shifts and their corresponding mappings or adjustments. In the context of the ALICE O2 simulation documentation, this array could be utilized to map shift indices or identifiers to specific simulation settings, parameters, or configurations. For example, it might hold information about which simulation parameters should be adjusted during particular shifts, or it could be used to map different types of detector shifts to their respective effects on the simulation results. This allows for easy lookup and application of shift-specific configurations within the simulation code.

**Question:** What is the value of the TPCCLUSTERTIMESHIFT variable for a run with cluster ID 529674?

**Answer:** The value of the TPCCLUSTERTIMESHIFT variable for a run with cluster ID 529674 is -26.4.

---

**Question:** What is the value of the TPCCLUSTERTIMESHIFT variable for a run with a cluster ID of 529674, and how is it calculated?

**Answer:** The value of the TPCCLUSTERTIMESHIFT variable for a run with a cluster ID of 529674 is -1.125. This value is calculated as follows: First, the script checks the mapShifts array for the specified cluster ID. For cluster ID 529674, the corresponding value in mapShifts is '22'. This value is then used to calculate TPCCLUSTERTIMESHIFT by dividing 22 by -8, and rounding to three decimal places using the bc command. Therefore, TPCCLUSTERTIMESHIFT = 22 / -8 = -2.75, which is then scaled to three decimal places to give -1.125.
