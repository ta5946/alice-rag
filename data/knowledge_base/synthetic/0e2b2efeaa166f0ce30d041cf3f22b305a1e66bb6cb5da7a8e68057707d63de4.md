**Question:** What is the default value of the `NWORKERS` variable if not specified when running the simulation script?

**Answer:** The default value of the `NWORKERS` variable is 8 if not specified when running the simulation script.

---

**Question:** What is the default value of the `SIMENGINE` variable if not specified when running the simulation script?

**Answer:** The default value of the `SIMENGINE` variable is TGeant4 if not specified when running the simulation script.

**Question:** What is the default seed value used if SPLITID is not set?

**Answer:** The default seed value used if SPLITID is not set is 0.

**Question:** What is the command used to create the simulation workflow, and what configuration keys are set during this step?

**Answer:** The command used to create the simulation workflow is:

```bash
$O2_SIM_WORKFLOW -eCM ${ENERGY} -col ${SYSTEM} -gen external -j ${NWORKERS} -ns ${NSIGEVENTS} -tf ${NTIMEFRAMES} -interactionRate ${INTRATE} -confKey "Diamond.width[0]=0.1;Diamond.width[1]=0.1;Diamond.width[2]=6." -e ${SIMENGINE} ${SEED} -ini $CFGINIFILE
```

During this step, the following configuration keys are set:

- `Diamond.width[0]=0.1`
- `Diamond.width[1]=0.1`
- `Diamond.width[2]=6.`

**Question:** What is the effect of the `SPLITID` variable on the seed used in the simulation, and how does it impact the reproducibility of the generated events?

**Answer:** The `SPLITID` variable influences the seed used in the simulation, determining whether a specific seed or a default seed is applied. If `SPLITID` is non-empty, the seed is set to the value of `SPLITID` using the `-seed ${SPLITID}` option, which can be a predefined value intended to ensure consistency across different runs. Conversely, if `SPLITID` is empty, the seed defaults to `0` using the `-seed 0` option, which allows for randomness in the event generation.

This mechanism directly impacts the reproducibility of the generated events. When `SPLITID` is provided, the simulation will produce the same sequence of events for identical input parameters across different runs, as the seed is explicitly set. This is crucial for validation and comparison purposes. On the other hand, when `SPLITID` is not provided (i.e., set to an empty string), each run will use a different seed (0), leading to a different sequence of random events, which is suitable for scenarios requiring varied outcomes in each run.
