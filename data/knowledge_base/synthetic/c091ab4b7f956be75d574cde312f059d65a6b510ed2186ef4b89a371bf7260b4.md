**Question:** What is the purpose of the `gdb --pid ${proc}` command in the script and how does it contribute to the overall functionality of the script?

**Answer:** The `gdb --pid ${proc}` command in the script serves to attach the GNU Debugger (gdb) to the process identified by the process ID stored in the variable `proc`. This command allows for the debugging of the process in real-time, enabling the inspection of the process's state, evaluation of expressions, and execution control. By attaching gdb to the running process, the script provides a means to analyze the process's behavior when it is found, contributing to the overall functionality of the script by ensuring that any issues can be traced and corrected. This mechanism is particularly useful for troubleshooting and maintaining the stability and performance of the processes managed by the script.
