**Question:** What is the command used to set the EPOS4 executable path in the script, and how does it change based on the value of the EPO4VSN environment variable?

**Answer:** The command used to set the EPOS4 executable path in the script is `EPOS4="$EPOS4_ROOT/epos4/scripts/epos"` for EPO4VSN "4.0.0" and `EPOS4="$EPOS4_ROOT/bin/epos"` for other versions. It changes based on the value of the EPO4VSN environment variable, directing to either the "scripts/epos" directory or the "bin/epos" directory within the EPOS4_ROOT directory.
