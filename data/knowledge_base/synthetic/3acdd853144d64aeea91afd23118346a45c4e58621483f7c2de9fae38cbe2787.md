**Question:** What is the main reason for migrating to "Modern" CMake usage in the ALICE O2 project?

**Answer:** The main reason for migrating to "Modern" CMake usage in the ALICE O2 project is to abandon the bucket system, which has proven to be ineffective in hiding genuine dependency issues within the build system.

---

**Question:** What are the main goals of migrating to "modern" CMake practices in the ALICE O2 simulation documentation, and how do they aim to achieve these goals?

**Answer:** The main goals of migrating to "modern" CMake practices in the ALICE O2 simulation documentation are to abandon the bucket system, which has been hiding genuine dependency issues in the build system. To achieve these goals, they aim to base everything on targets and minimize the use of variables and directory-specific functions, following the latest CMake community recommendations.

---

**Question:** What specific migration strategy is recommended to replace the "bucket system" in the build system, and what are the key practices involved in this migration according to the document?

**Answer:** The recommended migration strategy involves moving away from the "bucket system" by adopting the latest CMake practices suggested by the community. Key practices include the use of **targets** as the main mechanism to define and manage dependencies, minimizing the use of variables, and avoiding directory-specific functions. This approach aims to address and resolve genuine dependency issues that were previously masked by the bucket system.

---

**Question:** What is the main reason the document suggests using third-party `XXXConfig.cmake` files instead of custom `FindXXX.cmake` scripts?

**Answer:** The main reason the document suggests using third-party `XXXConfig.cmake` files instead of custom `FindXXX.cmake` scripts is to leverage the improved CMake integration provided by these third-party libraries, which offer reasonably good configuration files. This approach reduces complexity and avoids the need to create and maintain custom scripts, thereby simplifying the build process.

---

**Question:** Why did the authors choose to use their own functions instead of sticking to CMake's native functions for creating targets?

**Answer:** The authors chose to use their own functions instead of CMake's native functions for creating targets to avoid repetitive code in their CMakeLists.txt files and to enforce certain conventions more effectively. Using their own functions allowed them to standardize the build process, making it easier to maintain and manage across multiple CMakeLists.txt files.

---

**Question:** How did the decision to use custom functions instead of native CMake functions impact the enforceability of conventions in the CMakeLists.txt files, and what specific challenges were addressed by this choice in the context of the Alice O2 simulation project?

**Answer:** Using custom functions instead of native CMake functions significantly enhanced the enforceability of conventions within the CMakeLists.txt files for the Alice O2 simulation project. This choice addressed the challenge of maintaining consistent and standardized build practices across multiple CMakeLists.txt files. By opting for custom functions, the project could enforce specific conventions more effectively, as these functions could be tailored to include the necessary checks and requirements. The previous system, relying on repetitive code snippets, was less efficient for ensuring uniformity, as it required manual updates and verification. Custom functions, on the other hand, could be designed to automatically apply the desired conventions, thereby reducing the risk of inconsistencies and making the build process more robust and maintainable.

---

**Question:** What is one of the reasons for not using custom variables extensively in the CMakeLists.txt files?

**Answer:** One of the reasons for not using custom variables extensively in the CMakeLists.txt files is that most of the CMakeLists.txt can be written without any custom variables.

---

**Question:** What are the primary reasons for avoiding the use of custom variables in the CMakeLists.txt files according to the document?

**Answer:** The primary reasons for avoiding the use of custom variables in the CMakeLists.txt files, according to the document, are that most of these files can be written without any custom variables. While custom variables are not inherently bad, the document suggests that minimizing their use leads to cleaner and more straightforward CMakeLists.txt files.

---

**Question:** What specific changes were made to the original CMake functions and macros to enhance the clarity and scope management in the O2 simulation setup, and how do these changes impact the usage of custom variables?

**Answer:** The specific changes made to the original CMake functions and macros in the O2 simulation setup included:

- Using function names and parameter names that closely resemble those of the original CMake functions to reduce confusion for users familiar with CMake.
- Utilizing functions rather than macros, except where necessary, to prevent parameters from leaking into the parent scope, thereby enhancing scope management.
- Minimizing the use of custom variables, as most CMakeLists.txt files can be effectively written without relying on them, which helps in maintaining cleaner and more predictable code.

These changes impact the usage of custom variables by significantly reducing their reliance, thus making the CMakeLists.txt files more intuitive and less prone to unintended side effects.

---

**Question:** What is the naming convention for CMake function files in the ALICE O2 simulation documentation?

**Answer:** The naming convention for CMake function files in the ALICE O2 simulation documentation is as follows: the filename is in UpperCamelCase while the function name is in snake_case.

---

**Question:** Which CMake function would you use to add a test that links against multiple executables and libraries defined in the project, and what files in the `cmake` directory would you need to consult for the proper implementation?

**Question:** What are the three critical areas that developers should not focus on during the initial proof-of-concept step of rewriting the main CMakeLists.txt files?

**Answer:** During the initial proof-of-concept step of rewriting the main CMakeLists.txt files, developers should not focus on:
- GPU stuff
- Testing of Root macros
- Getting a proper O2Config.cmake produced (which is related to packaging)

---

**Question:** What are the three critical areas that should be addressed separately in the second step of the migration plan, and why are they considered critical and difficult?

**Answer:** In the second step of the migration plan, the three critical areas that should be addressed separately are:

1. GPU stuff, specifically involving GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) technologies like CUDA, HIP (Hierarchical Interactive Parallelism), and OpenCL (Open Computing Language). These are considered critical because they involve complex parallel computing environments and specialized hardware. Ensuring compatibility and performance across different GPU architectures and software frameworks is a significant challenge.

2. Testing of Root macros. Root is a data analysis framework often used in particle physics. Macros in Root are scripts written in a specific language that automate tasks. Testing these macros thoroughly is critical to ensure they work correctly with the new system. It is considered difficult because it requires extensive testing across various scenarios and configurations to guarantee reliability and accuracy.

3. Getting a proper O2Config.cmake produced. O2Config.cmake is a configuration file essential for the packaging and distribution of the O2 software. Producing this properly is critical because it ensures that all dependencies and settings are correctly configured and that the software can be built and installed correctly on different systems. This task is difficult due to the complexity of managing and ensuring the correct configuration of a large software suite.

---

**Question:** What is the current status of the macro testing (step 4) and under what conditions does it work?

**Answer:** The macro testing (step 4) is currently functional but only within the correct environment, specifically within an alibuild build. It is noted that running ctest without setting up the necessary environment beforehand is not supported at this time.

---

**Question:** What are the current limitations for running ctest, and why is its implementation in a non-alibuild environment deferred?

**Answer:** The current limitation for running ctest is that it must be executed within an alibuild build environment. This is because the macro testing, which is a prerequisite for ctest, is designed to work only in this specific setup. The implementation of ctest in a non-alibuild environment is deferred due to it being a non-trivial task and deviating from the current practices.

---

**Question:** What specific challenges are associated with running ctest outside of an alibuild environment, and why is this considered a departure from current practices?

**Answer:** Running ctest outside of an alibuild environment poses challenges due to the complex interdependencies and setup requirements of the O2 project. The alibuild environment ensures that all necessary dependencies and configurations are correctly set up, making it easier to run tests. Outside of this controlled environment, these dependencies might not be properly configured, leading to potential issues in test execution. This is considered a departure from current practices because the O2 project traditionally relies on the alibuild system for consistent and reliable test runs. Transitioning to running ctest without alibuild would require significant changes and additional setup steps, complicating the testing process.
