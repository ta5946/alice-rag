**Question:** What is the effect of setting `GPU_proc.debugLevel=1;` in the `CONFIG_EXTRA_PROCESS_o2_gpu_reco_workflow` configuration?

**Answer:** Setting `GPU_proc.debugLevel=1;` in the `CONFIG_EXTRA_PROCESS_o2_gpu_reco_workflow` configuration increases the debug level for the GPU processing workflow. This will result in more detailed debug information being output during the reconstruction process, which can be useful for diagnosing issues or understanding the workflow's behavior in more detail.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `WORKFLOWMODE=print` export in the given script, and how does it affect the workflow execution?

**Answer:** The `WORKFLOWMODE=print` export in the given script sets the workflow mode to print. This configuration instructs the GenTopo workflow to output its internal state or processing plan to the console without actually executing the steps that generate the final XML configuration files. As a result, the script will produce a printed summary of the workflow actions intended for the specified workflows, rather than performing the full set of operations necessary to create the XML files. This mode is useful for debugging or reviewing the intended workflow without incurring the computational cost of a full run.
