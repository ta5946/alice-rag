## Content

**Question:** What is the default value of the CPU limit if not specified in the script?

**Answer:** The default value of the CPU limit is 32, as indicated by the variable assignment `CPU_LIMIT=${CPU_LIMIT:-32}` in the script.

**Question:** What is the value of the `Diamond.width[2]` parameter set in the simulation configuration for the ccbar filter?

**Answer:** The value of the `Diamond.width[2]` parameter set in the simulation configuration for the ccbar filter is 6.

**Question:** What specific simulation engine is used for the event generation in this workflow, and what is the seed value if the `SPLITID` variable is set?

**Answer:** The specific simulation engine used for the event generation in this workflow is TGeant4. If the `SPLITID` variable is set, the seed value is the value of `SPLITID`.

**Question:** What does the `-tt aod` option do in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command?

**Answer:** The `-tt aod` option in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py command specifies that the analysis task type to be run is AOD (Analysis Object Data). This instructs the workflow runner to configure and execute tasks that are tailored for processing AOD files, which are intermediate data files containing reconstructed physics objects suitable for further analysis.

**Question:** What is the effect of using the `--cpu-limit 32` flag in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py script, and how does it interact with the specified number of CPUs in the `CPU_LIMIT` variable?

**Answer:** The `--cpu-limit 32` flag in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py script allows the workflow to utilize up to 32 CPU cores in parallel, increasing the timeframe parallelism. This is independent of the value of the `CPU_LIMIT` variable, as the flag explicitly sets the limit to 32 cores. However, if `CPU_LIMIT` is defined and is set to a value different from 32, the script will use the value of `CPU_LIMIT` instead, overriding the 32-core limit specified by the flag.

**Question:** What specific configuration changes would need to be made to this command if the goal is to run the workflow with a different parallelism level and a custom output directory?

**Answer:** To adjust the parallelism level and output directory, the following configuration changes would need to be made to the command:

```bash
${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod -p <new_parallelism_level> -o <custom_output_directory> --cpu-limit ${CPU_LIMIT}
```

Replace `<new_parallelism_level>` with the desired parallelism level and `<custom_output_directory>` with the path to the custom output directory.
