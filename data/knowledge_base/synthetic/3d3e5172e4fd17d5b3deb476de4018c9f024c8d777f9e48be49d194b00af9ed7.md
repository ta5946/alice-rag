**Question:** What command is used to set the number of events if it is not already specified in the options file?

**Answer:** The command used to set the number of events if it is not already specified in the options file is `sed -i "/nfull/c\set nfull $NEV" $optns.optns` if the line containing "nfull" already exists. If the line does not exist, the command appends `set nfull $NEV` to the end of the file.

**Question:** What command is used to check if the "ecms" option is present in the $optns.optns file, and what action is taken if it is found?

**Answer:** The command used to check if the "ecms" option is present in the $optns.optns file is `grep -Fq "ecms" $optns.optns`. If the "ecms" option is found, the line containing "ecms" is either edited using `sed -i "/ecms/c\set ecms $eCM"` to update the energy value to $eCM, or a new line "set ecms $eCM" is appended to the file if it is not already present.
