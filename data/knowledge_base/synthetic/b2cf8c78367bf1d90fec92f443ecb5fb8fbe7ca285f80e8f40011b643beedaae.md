**Question:** What is the default value of the `SEVERITY` variable in the script?

**Answer:** The default value of the `SEVERITY` variable in the script is `WARNING`.

**Question:** What is the default value for the `NTHREADS` variable and what does it control in the o2-ctf-writer-workflow?

**Answer:** The default value for the `NTHREADS` variable is 2. This variable controls the number of threads used in the o2-ctf-writer-workflow.

**Question:** What is the specific sequence of commands and arguments required to configure the o2-ctf-writer-workflow for FV0 detector data processing, including the CTF directory, maximum CTF files per directory, and meta-output directory, while ensuring that the output is written to the current directory?

**Answer:** The specific sequence of commands and arguments required to configure the o2-ctf-writer-workflow for FV0 detector data processing, including the CTF directory, maximum CTF files per directory, and meta-output directory, while ensuring that the output is written to the current directory are as follows:

1. Set the environment:
   - `source common/setenv.sh`

2. Configure the CTF dictionary:
   - `CTF_DICT="--ctf-dict $FILEWORKDIR/ctf_dictionary.root"`

3. Set the number of threads:
   - `NTHREADS=2`

4. Configure the output directory for the CTF to the current directory:
   - `ARGS_CTF="--min-file-size 500000000  --max-ctf-per-file 10000 --meta-output-dir /data/epn2eos_tool/epn2eos --append-det-to-period 0"`

   Note that to write to the current directory, the `--output-dir` argument should be removed from `o2-ctf-writer-workflow` or set to an empty string `CTFOUT=""`.

5. Define the proxy input specification:
   - `PROXY_INSPEC="digits:FV0/DIGITSBC/0;channels:FV0/DIGITSCH/0;eos:***/INFORMATION;dd:FLP/DISTSUBTIMEFRAME/0"`

6. Configure the input channel:
   - `IN_CHANNEL="--channel-config 'name=readout-proxy,type=pull,method=connect,address=ipc://@$INRAWCHANNAME,transport=shmem,rateLogging=1'"`

By setting `CTF_DIR=$FILEWORKDIR` and configuring `ARGS_CTF` as above, the CTF dictionary is stored in `$FILEWORKDIR/ctf_dictionary.root`, the maximum number of CTF files per directory is set to 10000, and the meta-output directory is set to `/data/epn2eos_tool/epn2eos`. To write to the current directory, ensure that `--output-dir` is not set or is set to an empty string.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--inject-missing-data` option in the o2-dpl-raw-proxy command?

**Answer:** The `--inject-missing-data` option in the o2-dpl-raw-proxy command is used to fill in any missing data in the readout, ensuring a complete set of data is processed and available for further analysis.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--inject-missing-data` option in the `o2-dpl-raw-proxy` command?

**Answer:** The `--inject-missing-data` option in the `o2-dpl-raw-proxy` command is used to add missing data entries in the readout, ensuring that all necessary data is present even if some data points are not available. This is particularly useful for maintaining the integrity and completeness of the data stream during processing.

**Question:** What specific configuration key values are required for the CTF writer workflow to write FV0 data to the specified CTF directory using a custom CTF dictionary?

**Answer:** The specific configuration key values required for the CTF writer workflow to write FV0 data to the specified CTF directory using a custom CTF dictionary include:

- `--configKeyValues "$ARGS_ALL_CONFIG;"` to pass all global configuration settings
- `--ctf-dict-dir $FILEWORKDIR` to specify the directory containing the custom CTF dictionary
- `--output-dir $CTF_DIR` to define the output directory for the CTF files
- `--onlyDet FV0` to ensure only FV0 data is written

These key values are passed through the pipeline to the CTF writer workflow to configure its operation as required.
