**Question:** What are the values of the `PROXY_INSPEC` and `CALIB_INSPEC` variables in the given script?

**Answer:** The values of the `PROXY_INSPEC` and `CALIB_INSPEC` variables in the given script are both set to "A:TPC/RAWDATA;dd:FLP/DISTSUBTIMEFRAME/0".

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `PROXY_INSPEC` and `CALIB_INSPEC` variables in the script, and how are they used?

**Answer:** The `PROXY_INSPEC` and `CALIB_INSPEC` variables in the script are both set to "A:TPC/RAWDATA;dd:FLP/DISTSUBTIMEFRAME/0". These variables specify the input specifications for proxy and calibration data, respectively, for the TPC (Time Projection Chamber) component in the O2 framework.

These input specifications are used to define how the data is accessed and formatted. In this case, the specifications indicate that the raw data from the TPC should be accessed, and it is expected to be in the form of distributed subtimeframes (DD:FLP/DISTSUBTIMEFRAME/0).

The values assigned to these variables are consistent, suggesting that both proxy and calibration processes are expected to use the same raw data from the TPC. This setup ensures that the necessary raw data is correctly identified and processed by the proxy and calibration components in the workflow.

**Question:** What specific configuration would be required to use a remote host instead of the default localhost for the O2 TPC raw data processing workflow?

**Answer:** To use a remote host instead of the default localhost for the O2 TPC raw data processing workflow, the `HOST` variable needs to be set to the IP address or hostname of the remote server. In the provided script, the `HOST` variable is currently set to `localhost`. To change it to a remote host, simply modify the line:

```bash
HOST=localhost
```

to:

```bash
HOST=remote-host-IP-or-Hostname
```

Replace `remote-host-IP-or-Hostname` with the actual IP address or hostname of the remote server where the TPC raw data processing workflow is to be executed.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `o2-tpc-raw-to-digits-workflow` command in the document?

**Answer:** The `o2-tpc-raw-to-digits-workflow` command is designed to convert raw TPC data into digitized form. It specifically includes options to ignore group data, process input from the calibration specification, remove duplicate entries, and utilize a defined pipeline for the conversion. This workflow is crucial for transforming raw experimental data into a format that can be further analyzed in subsequent stages of data processing.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--remove-duplicates` option in the `o2-tpc-raw-to-digits-workflow`?

**Answer:** The `--remove-duplicates` option in the `o2-tpc-raw-to-digits-workflow` is used to eliminate duplicate raw data entries, ensuring that only unique data points are processed into digits, which can help in reducing noise and improving the accuracy of the digitization process.

**Question:** What specific command-line arguments are used by the o2-tpc-krypton-raw-filter task to control the number of time bins processed and how they are distributed across output files?

**Answer:** The o2-tpc-krypton-raw-filter task uses the following command-line arguments to control the number of time bins processed and how they are distributed across output files:

- `--time-bins-before 20`: Specifies that 20 time bins should be processed before the data is written to the output file.
- `--max-time-bins 650`: Sets the maximum number of time bins to be processed in each output file to 650.
