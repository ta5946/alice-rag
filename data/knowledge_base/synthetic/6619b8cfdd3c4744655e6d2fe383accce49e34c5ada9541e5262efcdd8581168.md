**Question:** What is the default number of workers if not specified in the script?

**Answer:** The default number of workers if not specified in the script is 8.

**Question:** What configuration key is set to a diamond width of 6 units in the simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The configuration key set to a diamond width of 6 units in the simulation workflow is "Diamond.width[2]=6;".

---

**Question:** What specific configuration key is set for the diamond detector, and what is the effect of this configuration?

**Answer:** The specific configuration key set for the diamond detector is "Diamond.width[2]=6.;" which configures the width of the third layer of the diamond detector to be 6 units. This setting likely affects the detector's spatial resolution and sensitivity to certain types of particles or interactions within the detector volume.

**Question:** What is the command used to run the workflow with an increased CPU limit?

**Answer:** The command used to run the workflow with an increased CPU limit of 32 is:

${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod --cpu-limit 32

---

**Question:** What is the maximum number of parallel threads that can be used for the workflow execution according to the command provided?

**Answer:** The maximum number of parallel threads that can be used for the workflow execution according to the command provided is 32.

**Question:** What specific modification would you need to make to the command if you wanted to run the workflow with a CPU limit of 64 instead of 32, and how would this change affect the parallelism of the task execution?

**Answer:** To run the workflow with a CPU limit of 64 instead of 32, you would modify the command by changing the value after the --cpu-limit flag:

${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod --cpu-limit 64

This change would increase the parallelism of the task execution, allowing more tasks to run concurrently since a higher CPU limit enables more parallel threads or processes to be utilized simultaneously.
