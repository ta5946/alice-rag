## Content

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in the document and how does it transform the input file?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `sed` command in the document is to process an input file and modify its content, particularly to filter out HTML comments that contain doxygen keywords, and to replace code blocks in the file with a Markdown syntax. Specifically, it achieves this through three main transformations:

1. It removes lines that start with `<!-- doxy` and end with `doxy -->`.
2. It replaces ````c++` with `~~~{.cpp}`, ````bash` with `~~~{.sh}`, and simply ````` with `~~~` to conform with Markdown syntax for code blocks.

These changes facilitate better integration of the documentation into Markdown files, enhancing readability and compatibility with Markdown parsers.
