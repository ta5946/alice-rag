## Content

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in this document?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `sed` command in this document is to process and modify the content of a file to convert code block syntax from backticks (```) to the Markdown fenced code block syntax (~~~{.lang}), while also removing specific HTML comments that contain doxygen keywords.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in the document and how does it transform the input file?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `sed` command in the document is to process an input file and modify its content, particularly to filter out HTML comments that contain doxygen keywords, and to replace code blocks in the file with a Markdown syntax. Specifically, it achieves this through three main transformations:

1. It removes lines that start with `<!-- doxy` and end with `doxy -->`.
2. It replaces ````c++` with `~~~{.cpp}`, ````bash` with `~~~{.sh}`, and simply ````` with `~~~` to conform with Markdown syntax for code blocks.

These changes facilitate better integration of the documentation into Markdown files, enhancing readability and compatibility with Markdown parsers.

**Question:** What specific command-line instructions were previously applied in the .travis.yml file to modify the syntax highlighting in Markdown files?

**Answer:** The previous instructions applied in .travis.yml to modify the syntax highlighting in Markdown files were:

1. `git grep -l '^```[a-zA-Z]' | xargs sed -i .old -e 's|```\([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]*\)|\n```{.\1}\n|g;s|[.]bash|.sh|g;s|```|~~~~~~~|g'`

This command:
- Uses `git grep` to find lines starting with a triple backtick followed by a letter, and then pipes the results to `xargs`.
- The `sed` command edits the files in place, with backups saved as `.old` files.
- It replaces ````c++` with `~~~{.cpp}`, ````bash` with `~~~{.sh}`, and simply ````` with `~~~~~~~`.
- It also converts `.bash` to `.sh`.
