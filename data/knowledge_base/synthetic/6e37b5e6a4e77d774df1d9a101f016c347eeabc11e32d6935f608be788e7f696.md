**Question:** What happens if the user does not provide all required arguments when running the script?

**Answer:** If the user does not provide all required arguments when running the script, the script checks for this condition and outputs the following usage message:

```
Usage: $0 <commit-hash-A> <source-branch> <target-branch>
```

Then, the script exits with a status code of 1.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `modifies_common_files` function in the script?

**Answer:** The `modifies_common_files` function checks if two specified git commits modify at least one common file. This functionality is intended to determine whether there is a conflict when attempting to cherry-pick a commit, as cherry-picking a commit that modifies files also changed in another commit can lead to conflicts.

---

**Question:** What is the function of the `modifies_common_files` function in the script, and how does it determine if two commits modify any common files?

**Answer:** The `modifies_common_files` function checks if two specified commits modify at least one file in common. It accepts two commit hashes as input arguments. If the function is called with exactly two commit hashes, it proceeds to compare the files modified by these commits. The function does not explicitly mention how it performs this comparison, but it likely uses Git commands to list the files modified by each commit and then checks for intersections between these lists. If there is at least one common file between the two commits, the function returns true (or a success status); otherwise, it returns false (or a failure status).

---

**Question:** What will the output of the `can_swap_commits` function be if `commitA` and all commits in `commitB` have no common files with any other commit outside of `commitB`?

**Answer:** The `can_swap_commits` function will return 0. This is because the provided script checks for common files between `commitA` and each commit in `commitB`. Since it is stated that `commitA` and all commits in `commitB` have no common files with any other commit outside of `commitB`, the `common_files` variable will remain empty for each comparison. The script then checks if `common_files` is not empty, and since it is always empty, the function will return 0 at the end.

---

**Question:** What will be the output of the `can_swap_commits` function if `commitA` is "v1.2" and `commitB` is a list containing "v1.1", "v1.3", and "v1.4", assuming that "v1.1" and "v1.3" share common modified files, but "v1.2" and "v1.4" do not share common modified files with any commit in the list?

**Answer:** The `can_swap_commits` function will return 0. This is because the function will reverse the order of commits in the `commitB` list. In this case, the reversed list will be "v1.4", "v1.3", "v1.1". Then, it checks if `commitA` ("v1.2") can be swapped with any commit in the reversed list. Since "v1.3" and "v1.1" share common modified files, the function will find a match and return 0, indicating that a swap is possible.

---

**Question:** What does the `can_swap_commits` function do and how does it determine if two commits can be swapped?

**Answer:** The `can_swap_commits` function determines if commitA can be swapped with a list of commits (commitB) by checking if the commits contain any common modified files. It performs the following steps:

1. It takes the first argument as commitA and the remaining arguments as commitB, which is a list of commits to be swapped with commitA.
2. It creates a reverse copy of commitB, named reverseCommitList, to be iterated through in reverse order.
3. For each commit in reverseCommitList, it checks if there are any common modified files with commitA.
4. If any common files are found between commitA and any commit in reverseCommitList, it returns 1 (indicating that the commits cannot be swapped).
5. If no common files are found, it returns 0 (indicating that the commits can be swapped).

The function essentially checks for overlapping changes between commitA and the commits in commitB to decide if a swap is possible.

**Question:** What is the purpose of creating a temporary branch in this script?

**Answer:** The purpose of creating a temporary branch in this script is to test the cherry-picking of commits from one branch to another without affecting the original branches. Specifically, a new branch, named "temp_swap_test_branch", is created from the commit preceding the branch break-off point, allowing for the safe testing of commit swaps without altering the main branches.

---

**Question:** What does the script do if a cherry-picked commit results in a conflict during the process of swapping commits between two branches?

**Answer:** If a cherry-picked commit results in a conflict during the process of swapping commits between two branches, the script sets `RC` to 0, indicating that the commit swap cannot be completed due to conflicts. It then aborts the cherry-pick process using `git cherry-pick --abort`.

---

**Question:** What specific condition causes the script to reset to the original branch and delete the temporary branch, and what is the significance of the `BRANCHPOINT` variable in this context?

**Answer:** The script resets to the original branch and deletes the temporary branch if the cherry-pick operation fails for any commit in the list, indicated by a non-zero return code stored in `RC`. This signifies that conflicts occurred during the cherry-picking process, preventing the successful swap of commits.

The `BRANCHPOINT` variable represents the common ancestor commit between the source and target branches. It is used to identify the branch break-off point, which is essential for determining the range of commits that should be considered for cherry-picking.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `FILTERED_COMMITS1` array in the given script?

**Answer:** The `FILTERED_COMMITS1` array is used to store commit hashes that modify the same set of files as specified by the commit range `${cp_commit}^...${BRANCHPOINT}`. Initially, `COMMITLIST` contains all commit hashes within this range. The script iterates over each commit hash in `COMMITLIST`, checks if it modifies common files compared to `${cp_commit}` using the function `modifies_common_files`, and if so, adds it to `FILTERED_COMMITS1`. This filtering process ensures that only relevant commits, which touch the same files as `${cp_commit}`, are kept for further processing.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `FILTERED_COMMITS1` array in the script?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `FILTERED_COMMITS1` array is to store the commit hashes from `COMMITLIST` that modify the same set of files as specified by the ${cp_commit} commit. The script iterates over each commit in `COMMITLIST`, calls the `modifies_common_files` function to check if the commit modifies the same files as ${cp_commit}, and if so, adds the commit hash to `FILTERED_COMMITS1`.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `FILTERED_COMMITS1` array and how is it populated from the `COMMITLIST` array?

**Answer:** The `FILTERED_COMMITS1` array is used to store commit hashes from the `COMMITLIST` array that modify the same files as the initial commit, denoted by `${cp_commit}`. It is populated by iterating through each commit hash in `COMMITLIST` and using the `modifies_common_files` function to check if the commit modifies the same files as `${cp_commit}`. If the function returns 1, indicating that the commit modifies common files, then the commit hash is added to `FILTERED_COMMITS1`.

---

**Question:** What will happen if the commit hash in the loop is the same as the cp_commit?

**Answer:** If the commit hash in the loop is the same as the cp_commit, the script will not execute the can_swap_commits function for that commit hash, thus it will not be added to the CP_COMMIT_LIST array.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `can_swap_commits` function call in the script, and how does it affect the `CP_COMMIT_LIST` array?

**Answer:** The `can_swap_commits` function call checks whether a commit can be safely swapped or cherry-picked. If the function returns true (exit status 0), the commit is deemed compatible and added to the `CP_COMMIT_LIST` array. This ensures that only compatible commits are included in the final list of commits needed for the cherry-pick operation.

---

**Question:** How would the script be modified to also print the dependencies of each commit in the final cherry-pick list, assuming the `can_swap_commits` function can return these dependencies?

**Answer:** To modify the script to print the dependencies of each commit in the final cherry-pick list, you would need to update the `can_swap_commits` function to return not just whether the commit can be swapped, but also its dependencies. Assuming the function now returns dependencies in a format that can be easily accessed, such as a space-separated list, you can modify the script as follows:

```bash
for commit_hash in "${FILTERED_COMMITS1[@]}"; do
  if [ ! "${commit_hash}" == "${cp_commit}" ]; then
    dependencies=$(can_swap_commits "${commit_hash}" "${CP_COMMIT_LIST[@]}")
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      # echo "COMMIT ${commit_hash} is needed"
      # in this case we need to record it to the list of relevant commits
      # and also trace it's dependencies in turn
      CP_COMMIT_LIST+=(${commit_hash})
      IFS=' ' read -r -a DEP_ARRAY <<< "$dependencies"
      for dep in "${DEP_ARRAY[@]}"; do
        # Add dependencies to the CP_COMMIT_LIST if not already present
        if [[ ! " ${CP_COMMIT_LIST[*]} " =~ " ${dep} " ]]; then
          CP_COMMIT_LIST+=(${dep})
        fi
      done
    fi
  fi
done

# reverse the final list to have correct cherry-pick order

CP_COMMITS_REVERSED=()
for ((i=${#CP_COMMIT_LIST[@]}-1; i>=0; i--)); do
  CP_COMMITS_REVERSED+=("${CP_COMMIT_LIST[i]}")
done

# List the commits and their dependencies
echo "To cherry-pick ${cp_commit} onto branch ${target_branch}, we need to apply:"
for ((i=0;i<${#CP_COMMITS_REVERSED[@]}; i++)); do
  echo "${i}: ${CP_COMMITS_REVERSED[i]}"
  echo "  Dependencies: ${dependencies[@]}"
done

exit 0
```

In this modified script, after determining that the commit can be swapped, the dependencies are captured, and then added to the `CP_COMMIT_LIST` if they are not already present. Additionally, the script now prints the dependencies alongside each commit in the final list.
