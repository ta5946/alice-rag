**Question:** What specific information must be present in the current working directory to run the hybrid generator example successfully?

**Answer:** To run the hybrid generator example successfully, the following information must be present in the current working directory:

- The `example.optns` file, which contains options for EPOS4 as the subgenerator in the example.
- The `hybridconfig.json` file, an example JSON file for configuring the hybrid generator.

**Question:** What steps are required to use the Hybrid generator with the o2-sim, and how does the runo2sim.sh script facilitate this process?

**Answer:** To use the Hybrid generator with o2-sim, you need to load the O2sim package and specify the GeneratorHybrid.configFile parameter with a JSON file generated by ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_hybrid_gen.py. The runo2sim.sh script simplifies this process by including most available generators. You can run the example automatically by executing this script after giving it execution permissions (`chmod +x runo2sim.sh`). This script streamlines the setup, allowing you to simply copy the Hybrid example folder and then run the script.
