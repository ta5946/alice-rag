**Question:** What is the default number of workers used in the simulation if not specified otherwise?

**Answer:** The default number of workers used in the simulation if not specified otherwise is 8.

**Question:** What is the default number of worker processes if the NWORKERS environment variable is not set?

**Answer:** The default number of worker processes is 8 if the NWORKERS environment variable is not set.

**Question:** What specific configuration key is used to set the diamond detector dimensions, and what are the exact values assigned to these dimensions in the simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The specific configuration key used to set the diamond detector dimensions is "Diamond.width". The exact values assigned to these dimensions in the simulation workflow are:

- Diamond.width[0] = 0.005
- Diamond.width[1] = 0.005
- Diamond.width[2] = 6

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `-tt aod` parameter in the command?

**Answer:** The `-tt aod` parameter specifies the task type as AOD (Analysis Object Data) in the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py script. This indicates that the workflow should generate or process AOD files, which are the primary data format used for physics analysis in the ALICE experiment.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--cpu-limit` option when running the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py script, and what value is set for it in this workflow?

**Answer:** The `--cpu-limit` option in the `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` script is used to specify the maximum number of CPU cores to be used for the workflow execution. In this particular workflow configuration, the value set for the `--cpu-limit` is 32, indicating that the workflow will be executed with a limit of 32 CPU cores.

**Question:** What specific actions would need to be taken if the workflow.json file contained multiple job steps that each require different CPU limits, and how would you modify the command to accommodate these varying requirements while still using a total CPU limit of 32?

**Answer:** To accommodate multiple job steps in workflow.json with different CPU requirements while maintaining a total CPU limit of 32, you would need to adjust the command to specify a different --cpu-limit for each step, if supported by the o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py script. However, if the script only allows a single --cpu-limit option, you would have to split the workflow into separate runs, each with its own --cpu-limit that adds up to 32. 

For instance, if you have two steps with CPU requirements of 16 and 16, you would run two separate commands:

1. ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod --cpu-limit 16
2. ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod --cpu-limit 16

If the script supports specifying individual CPU limits for each step, you would need to consult its documentation for the correct syntax.
