**Question:** What is the purpose of the script described in the document?

**Answer:** The purpose of the script is to run the simulation of Pythia8 pp INEL events with a multiplicity trigger, using a specified number of workers and events, and configuring the simulation details via an INI file.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--configFile` option in the `o2-sim` command and what file is it set to point to in this script?

**Answer:** The `--configFile` option in the `o2-sim` command is used to specify the configuration file for the simulation. In this script, it is set to point to `../MC/config/examples/ini/trigger_multiplicity.ini`.

---

**Question:** What specific trigger configuration is used in the simulation and where is it defined?

**Answer:** The specific trigger configuration used in the simulation is defined by the INI config file "trigger_multiplicity.ini". This file is located at `${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/config/examples/ini/trigger_multiplicity.ini`.
