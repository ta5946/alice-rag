## Content

**Question:** What action is taken if the last AOD file size is less than the minimum allowed percentage size?

**Answer:** If the last AOD file size is less than the minimum allowed percentage size, the script merges it with the second-to-last AOD file. This is determined by checking the percentage size of the last AOD file against the minimum allowed percentage size, which defaults to 20% if not specified. If the percentage is less than the threshold, the script identifies the second-to-last AOD file and proceeds with merging.

**Question:** What action is taken if the number of subjobs for the current masterjob is less than or equal to the keep ratio and the index of the input file is 1?

**Answer:** If the number of subjobs for the current masterjob is less than or equal to the keep ratio and the index of the input file is 1, the script will force the output to keep the intermediate files. This is indicated by the message "**** NOT ENOUGH SUBJOBS TO SAMPLE, WE WILL FORCE TO KEEP THE OUTPUT ****" being echoed, followed by setting the variable keep to 1 and breaking out of the while loop.

**Question:** What happens if the environment variable `NTIMEFRAMES` is not set when the script runs?

**Answer:** If the environment variable `NTIMEFRAMES` is not set when the script runs, it will be exported with a value of `-1`.

---

**Question:** What will be the value of `O2DPGPATH` if `ALIEN_JDL_LPMPRODUCTIONTAG` is set but `ALIEN_JDL_O2DPGPATH` is not set?

**Answer:** The value of `O2DPGPATH` will be set to the value of `PERIOD` if `ALIEN_JDL_LPMPRODUCTIONTAG` is set but `ALIEN_JDL_O2DPGPATH` is not set.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the file `runInput_$RUNNUMBER.tgz` does not exist when the mode is set to "remote"?

**Answer:** If the file `runInput_$RUNNUMBER.tgz` does not exist when the mode is set to "remote", the script will output "No runInput_$RUNNUMBER.tgz, let's hope we don't need it" and proceed without the file.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `ALIEN_JDL_*` environment variables in the script?

**Answer:** The `ALIEN_JDL_*` environment variables are used to specify job parameters for the asynchronous processing in the script. They provide necessary configuration details such as run number, interaction type, production tag, pass name, and anchor year, which are essential for the processing tasks to be executed correctly.

---

**Question:** What is the default value of SHMSIZE if neither ALIEN_JDL_SHMSIZE nor SHMSIZE are set?

**Answer:** The default value of SHMSIZE, if neither ALIEN_JDL_SHMSIZE nor SHMSIZE are set, is \(16 \times 2^{30}\) bytes, which is equivalent to 16 GiB.

---

**Question:** What are the steps taken to handle the failure of sourcing the `gen_topo_helper_functions.sh` script?

**Answer:** The steps taken to handle the failure of sourcing the `gen_topo_helper_functions.sh` script involve a conditional statement. If the sourcing operation fails, an error message "gen_topo_helper_functions.sh failed" is printed, and the script exits with a status code of 5.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the QC JSON file is found in the `${GEN_TOPO_WORKDIR}/json_cache` directory?

**Answer:** If the QC JSON file is found in the `${GEN_TOPO_WORKDIR}/json_cache` directory, the latest file in that directory is identified and assigned to the `QC_JSON` variable. Then, this file is copied to the current directory and named `QC_production.json`.

---

**Question:** What is the condition for the script to execute the matching, QC, calib, and AOD steps in the workflow?

**Answer:** The script will execute the matching, QC, calib, and AOD steps if the following conditions are met:

- The variable ALIEN_JDL_SPLITSTEP is not set.
- ALIEN_JDL_SPLITSTEP is equal to 3.
- ALIEN_JDL_SPLITSTEP is set and its value is less than or equal to 3.
- ALIEN_JDL_SPLITSTEP is set to "all".

---

**Question:** What is the sequence of operations that will be triggered if the environment variables ALIEN_JDL_DOEMCCALIB, ALIEN_JDL_DOTPCRESIDUALEXTRACTION, ALIEN_JDL_DOTRDVDRIFTEXBCALIB, and ALIEN_JDL_DOMEANVTXCALIB are all set, and how do they affect the value of the ADD_CALIB variable?

**Answer:** If all the environment variables ALIEN_JDL_DOEMCCALIB, ALIEN_JDL_DOTPCRESIDUALEXTRACTION, ALIEN_JDL_DOTRDVDRIFTEXBCALIB, and ALIEN_JDL_DOMEANVTXCALIB are set, the following sequence of operations will be triggered:

1. The value of the ADD_CALIB variable will be set to 1.

This is done through the execution of the if statements in the provided script. Each if statement checks if a specific environment variable is set (not empty). If a variable is set, it sets the ADD_CALIB variable to 1. 

Since all four variables are set, the ADD_CALIB variable will be set to 1 four times, but the final value of ADD_CALIB will remain 1 as it is overwritten each time. Therefore, the final value of ADD_CALIB will be 1, indicating that calibration will be added in the simulation.

---

**Question:** What conditions determine the value of the `INPUT_TYPE` variable and how does it affect the workflow parameters in the script?

**Answer:** The `INPUT_TYPE` variable is determined by checking if the `ALIEN_JDL_INPUTTYPE` environment variable is set to "TFs". If this condition is met, `INPUT_TYPE` is set to "TF" and additional workflow parameters are defined by exporting `WORKFLOW_PARAMETERS=CTF`. Furthermore, if the `RUNNUMBER` is less than 523141 and `INPUT_TYPE` is "TF", the environment variable `TPC_CONVERT_LINKZS_TO_RAW` is set to 1.

If `ALIEN_JDL_INPUTTYPE` is not set to "TFs", the `INPUT_TYPE` is set to "CTF", indicating that the workflow will use CTF as the input type. This affects the workflow parameters and potentially other aspects of the simulation by changing how data is processed and handled.

---

**Question:** What is the significance of the exit code 255 in this script and how does it relate to the validation process?

**Answer:** The exit code 255 in this script signifies an error condition during the validation process. Specifically, the script constructs a validation_error.message file containing details about the number of CTFiles inspected, processed, and found to be OK in two different steps. Following this, the script exits with status code 255, indicating that a problem was encountered and the validation did not pass successfully.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the input file has a ".xml" extension, and how does it differ from processing a ".root" file?

**Answer:** If the input file has a ".xml" extension, the script uses `sed` to extract URLs from the XML file and writes them to `list.list`. The `MODE` is set to "remote" for this case. It differs from processing a ".root" file in the following ways:

- For ".root" files, the script directly writes the filename to `list.list` and sets `MODE` to "LOCAL". It also has an option to duplicate the entry in `list.list` based on the `ASYNC_BENCHMARK_ITERATIONS` variable.
- For ".xml" files, the script processes the content to find and list only the URLs, not the entire file paths, and does not provide an option for local processing via `ASYNC_BENCHMARK_ITERATIONS`.

---

**Question:** What will be removed and updated during the script execution, and how are these directories determined?

**Answer:** During the script execution, the directory `$AOD_DIR_TO_BE_REMOVED` will be removed, and the directory `$AOD_DIR_TO_BE_UPDATED` will be updated. These directories are determined as follows:

- The directory to be removed, `$AOD_DIR_TO_BE_REMOVED`, is derived from the value of `$AOD_LAST` by removing the `AO2D.root` file name using `sed`.
- The directory to be updated, `$AOD_DIR_TO_BE_UPDATED`, is derived from the value of `$AOD_LAST_BUT_ONE` by removing the `AO2D.root` file name using `sed`.

---

**Question:** What action is taken if the exit code from the merging process is not zero?

**Answer:** If the exit code from the merging process is not zero, the following action is taken:
```
echo "Exit code from the process merging DFs inside AO2D for ${aods[$i]} is " $exitcode > validation_error.message
```

---

**Question:** What command is used to create a symbolic link to the `list.list` file in the `tmpAOD` directory, and why is this step necessary?

**Answer:** The command used to create a symbolic link to the `list.list` file in the `tmpAOD` directory is `ln -s ../list.list .`. This step is necessary because the `o2-aod-merger` tool requires the `list.list` file to be present in the current working directory, which is `tmpAOD` in this case. By creating a symbolic link, the script ensures that the necessary file is accessible to the merger tool without actually copying the file, thereby saving disk space.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the `setenv_extra` variable is not defined for a specific O2DPG pass?

**Answer:** No actions are taken to set special settings when `setenv_extra` is not defined for a specific O2DPG pass. The system will output a message indicating that no special settings will be used.

---

**Question:** What action is taken if the local "setenv_extra.sh" file does not exist in the script?

**Answer:** If the local "setenv_extra.sh" file does not exist, the script will inform that no ad-hoc setenv_extra settings are available for the current async processing and will instead use the setenv_extra.sh file located at $O2DPG_ROOT/DATA/production/configurations/$ALIEN_JDL_LPMANCHORYEAR/$O2DPGPATH/$PASS/setenv_extra.sh. It will create a symbolic link to this file and then proceed to source it, checking for errors and exiting with code 7 if sourcing fails.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `DISABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT`, `IS_SIMULATED_DATA`, and `WORKFLOWMODE` variables in the script?

**Answer:** The `DISABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT`, `IS_SIMULATED_DATA`, and `WORKFLOWMODE` variables serve specific purposes in the script:

- `DISABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT=0`: This variable controls whether root output is disabled. Setting it to `0` ensures that root output is enabled, which is typically necessary for data processing and analysis in the simulation environment.

- `IS_SIMULATED_DATA=0`: This variable indicates that the script is not dealing with simulated data. Setting it to `0` suggests that the script is intended for processing real data, as opposed to simulated data, ensuring that the correct data handling procedures are followed.

- `WORKFLOWMODE=run`: This variable specifies the mode of operation for the workflow. Setting it to `run` indicates that the script is in a run mode, which likely means that it is configured to execute the data processing steps in a sequential or pipeline manner, as opposed to a different mode like validation or configuration.

These variables are used to configure the environment and behavior of the script, ensuring that it operates correctly in the context of data processing and simulation.

---

**Question:** What happens if both the environment variable `ALIEN_JDL_TFDELAYSECONDS` and `ALIEN_JDL_USETHROTTLING` are set?

**Answer:** If both the environment variables `ALIEN_JDL_TFDELAYSECONDS` and `ALIEN_JDL_USETHROTTLING` are set, `TFDELAYSECONDS` will be assigned the value of `ALIEN_JDL_TFDELAYSECONDS`. However, since `ALIEN_JDL_USETHROTTLING` is also set, `TIMEFRAME_RATE_LIMIT` will be set to `1`. Despite `ALIEN_JDL_TFDELAYSECONDS` being defined, its value will override the default `TFDELAYSECONDS=40` setting.

---

**Question:** What is the difference between `nCTFsFilesOK_step1` and `nCTFsFilesOK_step2` in terms of their calculation based on the provided script?

**Answer:** `nCTFsFilesOK_step1` and `nCTFsFilesOK_step2` are both calculated to obtain the number of CTF files that are OK, but they differ in the step they are associated with and the input file they process:

- `nCTFsFilesOK_step1` extracts the number from files named with "_reco_1.stat". These files are related to the first step of the process, likely involving initial reconstruction or analysis.
  
- `nCTFsFilesOK_step2` extracts the number from files named with "_reco_2.stat". These files are related to the second step of the process, probably involving a subsequent or more detailed reconstruction or analysis.

In both cases, the extraction is done using a similar sed command: `sed 's/^[0-9]*_\([0-9]*\)_.*/\1/'`, which captures the second group of digits in the filename, representing the number of CTF files that are OK. However, the context and nature of the files (i.e., step1 vs step2) and the specific reconstruction or analysis phase they represent are different.

---

**Question:** What will be the value of `SETTING_ROOT_OUTPUT` if the variable `keep` is set to 1 and why?

**Answer:** If the variable `keep` is set to 1, the value of `SETTING_ROOT_OUTPUT` will be `DISABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT=0`. This is because the conditional statement checks if `keep` is equal to 1. If the condition is true, the line `SETTING_ROOT_OUTPUT+="DISABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT=0";` is executed, appending `DISABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT=0` to the `SETTING_ROOT_OUTPUT` variable. If `keep` is not 1, `SETTING_ROOT_OUTPUT` will retain any previously assigned value or be empty if no value was assigned before.

---

**Question:** What action is taken if there is an inconsistency between step 1 and step 2 in terms of the number of CTF files or single CTFs processed?

**Answer:** If there is an inconsistency between step 1 and step 2 in terms of the number of CTF files or single CTFs processed, the following actions are taken:

- An echo command is used to print an error message to the standard output, indicating the inconsistency.
- The error message includes details of the counts for each of the following variables:
  - `nCTFsFilesInspected_step1` and `nCTFsFilesInspected_step2`
  - `nCTFsFilesOK_step1` and `nCTFsFilesOK_step2`
  - `nCTFsFilesFailed_step1` and `nCTFsFilesFailed_step2`
  - `nCTFsProcessed_step1` and `nCTFsProcessed_step2`
- Another echo command writes the same error message to a file named `validation_error.message`.

---

**Question:** What will happen to intermediate files when the script runs in LOCAL mode and the environment variable DO_NOT_KEEP_OUTPUT_IN_LOCAL is set to 1?

**Answer:** Intermediate files will not be kept when the script runs in LOCAL mode and the environment variable DO_NOT_KEEP_OUTPUT_IN_LOCAL is set to 1.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `timeStart` and `timeEnd` variables in the script?

**Answer:** The `timeStart` and `timeEnd` variables in the script are used to measure the duration of the process of splitting the performance metrics into individual files. Specifically, `timeStart` records the start time of this operation, while `timeEnd` captures the end time. The difference between these two values, calculated as `delta=$(( $timeEnd-$timeStart ))`, gives the total time spent on splitting the metrics files, which is then echoed to the output with the message "Time spent in splitting the metrics files = $delta s".

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the `CALIB_WORKFLOW_FROM_OUTSIDE` environment variable is not set when the `ADD_CALIB` variable is true?

**Answer:** If the `CALIB_WORKFLOW_FROM_OUTSIDE` variable is not set when `ADD_CALIB` is true, the script will use `calib-workflow.sh` from the O2 package. Specifically, it will copy `calib-workflow.sh` located at `$O2_ROOT/prodtests/full-system-test/calib-workflow.sh` into the current directory.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the file "Analysis/MergedAnalyses/AnalysisResults.root" is found, and what message is displayed if it is not found?

**Answer:** If the file "Analysis/MergedAnalyses/AnalysisResults.root" is found, the script moves it to the current directory using the command `mv Analysis/MergedAnalyses/AnalysisResults.root .`.

If the file is not found, the script displays the message "No Analysis/MergedAnalyses/AnalysisResults.root found! check analysis QC" to inform the user about the missing file.

---

**Question:** What command is used to create the analysis workflow in the script?

**Answer:** The command used to create the analysis workflow in the script is:

time ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/analysis_testing/o2dpg_analysis_test_workflow.py -f AO2D.root

---

**Question:** What will happen if the "latest_reco_1.log" file does not exist when the script runs?

**Answer:** If the "latest_reco_1.log" file does not exist when the script runs, the script will execute the commands within the "fi" block, which is the else statement. Specifically, it will output the message "We will run the workflow in SPLIT mode!" and set the variable WORKFLOW_PARAMETERS_START to the value of WORKFLOW_PARAMETERS.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `mv latest.log latest_reco_2.log` command and how does it relate to the workflow process described in the document?

**Answer:** The `mv latest.log latest_reco_2.log` command is used to rename the `latest.log` file to `latest_reco_2.log`. This command is part of the workflow process described, likely serving to standardize the naming of log files for consistency across different steps or iterations of the workflow. This renaming allows for clear distinction between output logs from various stages of the workflow, ensuring that the log from the current step (Step 2) is properly identified and can be easily referenced or compared with previous steps. Specifically, the log from the previous step would be named `latest_reco_1.log`, and the current step's log is renamed to `latest_reco_2.log`. This practice aids in log management and facilitates comparison and validation between successive steps in the workflow.

---

**Question:** What action is taken if the AO2D with merged DataFrames check fails?

**Answer:** If the AO2D with merged DataFrames check fails, the script will keep the AO2Ds with unmerged DataFrames and generate an error message indicating the failure.

---

**Question:** What command is executed to start the workflow after the initial checks and configurations in the given script segment?

**Answer:** The command executed to start the workflow after the initial checks and configurations is:

```
timeStart=`date +%s`
if [[ "0$RUN_WORKFLOW" != "00" ]]; then
  ./run-workflow-on-inputlist.sh $INPUT_TYPE list.list >> workflowconfig.log
fi
```

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `timeStart` and `timeEnd` variables in the script, and how are they used to calculate the time spent running the workflow?

**Answer:** The `timeStart` and `timeEnd` variables are used to measure the execution time of the workflow. Specifically, `timeStart` captures the current time in seconds since the epoch before the workflow starts executing, while `timeEnd` records the current time at the end of the workflow execution. By subtracting `timeStart` from `timeEnd`, the script calculates the duration of the workflow execution in seconds, which is stored in the `delta` variable. This time is then printed to the console with the message "Time spent in running the workflow, Step 3 = $delta s", allowing the user to understand how long the workflow took to complete.

---

**Question:** What is the value of `GPUMEMSIZE` and how is it calculated?

**Answer:** The value of `GPUMEMSIZE` is calculated as `25 << 30`. This expression shifts the number 25 left by 30 bits, resulting in 2,500,000,000 bytes, which is equivalent to 25 gigabytes (GB).

---

**Question:** What value does the script assign to `KEEPRATIO` if `NKEEP` is set to 5?

**Answer:** The script assigns a value of 200 to `KEEPRATIO` if `NKEEP` is set to 5. This is calculated as `1000 / 5` since `KEEPRATIO` is set to `1000/NKEEP` when `NKEEP` is greater than 0.

---

**Question:** What additional root output settings are enabled if both $ALIEN_JDL_DOTRDVDRIFTEXBCALIB and $ALIEN_JDL_DOMEANVTXCALIB are set to "1"?

**Answer:** The additional root output settings enabled if both $ALIEN_JDL_DOTRDVDRIFTEXBCALIB and $ALIEN_JDL_DOMEANVTXCALIB are set to "1" are:

- ENABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT_o2_trd_global_tracking
- ENABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT_o2_calibration_trd_workflow
- ENABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT_o2_primary_vertexing_workflow
- ENABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT_o2_tfidinfo_writer_workflow

---

**Question:** What command is used to print the workflow configuration when the $ALIEN_JDL_SPLITWF environment variable is not set to 1?

**Answer:** The command used to print the workflow configuration when the $ALIEN_JDL_SPLITWF environment variable is not set to 1 is:

env $SETTING_ROOT_OUTPUT IS_SIMULATED_DATA=0 WORKFLOWMODE=print TFDELAY=$TFDELAYSECONDS ./run-workflow-on-inputlist.sh $INPUT_TYPE list.list > workflowconfig.log

---

**Question:** What command is used to check AO2Ds with un-merged DFs, and what log file is created during this process?

**Answer:** The command used to check AO2Ds with un-merged DFs is `time root -l -b -q $O2DPG_ROOT/DATA/production/common/readAO2Ds.C > checkAO2D.log`. This command is executed after checking if "AO2D.root" exists in the directory. The log file created during this process is `checkAO2D.log`.

---

**Question:** What is the sequence of commands executed for step 2 if the condition `[[ "$ALIEN_JDL_SPLITSTEP" -eq 2 ]]` is met?

**Answer:** The sequence of commands executed for step 2 if the condition `[[ "$ALIEN_JDL_SPLITSTEP" -eq 2 ]]` is met includes:

1. Setting `WORKFLOW_PARAMETERS` to its initial value: `WORKFLOW_PARAMETERS=$WORKFLOW_PARAMETERS_START`
2. Logging the start of the decoding and reconstruction process: `echo "Step 2) Decoding and reconstructing ALL-TPC"` and `echo -e "\nStep 2) Decoding and reconstructing ALL-TPC" >> workflowconfig.log`
3. Iterating over a set of detectors (AOD, QC, CALIB, CALIB_LOCAL_INTEGRATED_AGGREGATOR) and modifying the `WORKFLOW_PARAMETERS` environment variable to exclude each of these detectors from the process, using `sed` to remove them: 
   - Removing trailing commas and the detector name from the beginning of the string: `sed -e "s/,$i,/,/g" -e "s/^$i,//"`
   - Removing leading commas and the detector name from the end of the string: `sed -e "s/,$i"'$'"//" -e "s/^$i"'$'"//"`
4. Running the `run-workflow-on-inputlist.sh` script with the updated parameters, excluding the TPC detector, and logging the command: 
   - Setting environment variables: `export DISABLE_ROOT_OUTPUT=0`, `export IS_SIMULATED_DATA=0`, `export WORKFLOWMODE=print`, `export TFDELAY=$TFDELAYSECONDS`
   - Running the script with the following parameters: `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS=ALL`, `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE=TPC`, `./run-workflow-on-inputlist.sh $INPUT_TYPE list.list >> workflowconfig.log`
5. Optionally starting a timer for the workflow execution if the `RUN_WORKFLOW` variable is not set to 00: `timeStart=`date +%s``

---

**Question:** What action is taken if the merging of data frames inside the AO2D for a specific AOD does not work correctly?

**Answer:** If the merging of data frames inside the AO2D for a specific AOD does not work correctly, no action is taken for that file; the script will skip processing that AOD and move on to the next one.

---

**Question:** What is the value of `SHMSIZE` when the `ASYNC_PASS_NO_OPTIMIZED_DEFAULTS` is not set to 1 and the run IR is less than 50000?

**Answer:** The value of `SHMSIZE` when `ASYNC_PASS_NO_OPTIMIZED_DEFAULTS` is not set to 1 and the run IR is less than 50000 is 16000000000.
