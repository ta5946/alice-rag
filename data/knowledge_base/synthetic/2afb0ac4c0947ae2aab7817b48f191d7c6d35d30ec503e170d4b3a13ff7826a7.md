**Question:** What does the regex pattern "-e \"line.*Killed\" \\\n     -e \"\*\*\* Error in\" " specifically target in the context of error messages?

**Answer:** The regex pattern "-e "line.*Killed"" \\\n     -e "\*\*\* Error in"" is specifically targeting lines that contain the phrase "line.*Killed" or begin with "*** Error in".
