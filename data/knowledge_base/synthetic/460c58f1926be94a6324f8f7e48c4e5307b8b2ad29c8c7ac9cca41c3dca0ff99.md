**Question:** What will happen if the environment variable O2_ROOT is not set when this script is executed?

**Answer:** If the environment variable O2_ROOT is not set when this script is executed, the script will check for its presence using the condition `[ "0$O2_ROOT" == "0" ]`. Since O2_ROOT is not set, it will be an empty string, making the condition true. As a result, the script will output "O2 environment not loaded" to stderr and exit with a status code of 1.
