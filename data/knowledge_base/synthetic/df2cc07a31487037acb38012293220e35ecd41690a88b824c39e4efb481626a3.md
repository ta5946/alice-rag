## Content

**Question:** What platform is used for discussing questions about ALICE simulation in general?

**Answer:** The platform used for discussing questions about ALICE simulation in general is the Mattermost Run3 Simulation channel.

**Question:** What is the frequency of the Detector simulation meetings and which CERN E-group is used for announcements?

**Answer:** The Detector simulation meetings occur every 2 or 3 weeks on Wednesday afternoons (starting at 3pm). Announcements for these meetings are sent to the `alice-o2-wp12` CERN E-group.

**Question:** What is the primary difference between the Mattermost O2DPG channel and the Mattermost Run3 Simulation channel in terms of their focus on ALICE simulation?

**Answer:** The primary difference between the Mattermost O2DPG channel and the Mattermost Run3 Simulation channel in terms of their focus on ALICE simulation is that the O2DPG channel specifically discusses the O2DPG MC production system, whereas the Run3 Simulation channel is more broadly dedicated to addressing questions about ALICE simulation in general.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the dedicated meeting category for ALICE3 related simulation discussions?

**Answer:** The purpose of the dedicated meeting category for ALICE3 related simulation discussions is to provide a specific forum for addressing and debating topics related to the simulation aspects of ALICE3. This facilitates organized and focused communication among team members regarding simulation challenges, improvements, and new developments pertinent to ALICE3.

**Question:** What specific steps should be taken if a user encounters a critical issue that requires immediate attention and cannot be addressed through a JIRA ticket?

**Answer:** If a user encounters a critical issue that requires immediate attention and cannot be addressed through a JIRA ticket, they should follow the specific steps outlined for the dedicated [meeting category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12828/) for ALICE3 related simulation discussions. This involves contacting the relevant meeting organizers or participants directly through the meeting platform to ensure swift resolution of the critical issue.
