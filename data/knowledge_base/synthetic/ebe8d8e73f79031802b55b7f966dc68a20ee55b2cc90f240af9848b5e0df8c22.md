**Question:** What is the default value for the number of signal events (`NSIGEVENTS`) if not specified?

**Answer:** The default value for the number of signal events (`NSIGEVENTS`) if not specified is 1.

**Question:** What specific command-line arguments are used to configure the background events in the simulation, and how do they affect the event generation process?

**Answer:** The specific command-line arguments used to configure the background events in the simulation are:

- `-genBkg pythia8`: This specifies that the background events will be generated using Pythia8.
- `-procBkg inel`: This sets the background processing to inelastic events.
- `--embedding`: This enables the embedding of background events into signal events.
- `-nb ${NBKGEVENTS}`: This sets the number of background events to be generated, where `${NBKGEVENTS}` is a variable that defaults to 1 if not specified.

These arguments affect the event generation process by defining the type of background events (Pythia8 inelastic events), the number of background events to be generated, and the method of embedding these events into the signal events.
