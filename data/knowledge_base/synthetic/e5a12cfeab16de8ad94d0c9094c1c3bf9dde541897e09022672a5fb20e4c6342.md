**Question:** What is the purpose of the `continue` statement in the script and which specific file does it affect?

**Answer:** The `continue` statement in the script skips the processing of `analyses_config.json` files. It affects any `.json` file found in the current directory and its subdirectories, except for those named `analyses_config.json`.
