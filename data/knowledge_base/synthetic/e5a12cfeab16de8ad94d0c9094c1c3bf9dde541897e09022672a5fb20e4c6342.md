## Content

**Question:** What does the script do to the JSON files it finds?

**Answer:** The script iterates over all files found in the current directory and its subdirectories, identifying those with a .json extension. For each JSON file, except for ones named analyses_config.json, it formats the file using the jq tool with the pretty-printing option (-S). The formatted content is then redirected to a temporary file named a.json, which is subsequently renamed back to the original JSON file name.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `continue` statement in the script and which specific file does it affect?

**Answer:** The `continue` statement in the script skips the processing of `analyses_config.json` files. It affects any `.json` file found in the current directory and its subdirectories, except for those named `analyses_config.json`.

**Question:** What specific conditions cause the script to skip formatting the `analyses_config.json` files, and how does this affect the final output of the json files processed by the script?

**Answer:** The script skips formatting the `analyses_config.json` files when it encounters them. This is achieved using a case statement that checks if the filename matches the pattern `*analyses_config.json*`. If the filename matches, the `continue` command is executed, which skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next file.

The effect of this on the final output is that `analyses_config.json` files will not be formatted by `jq`. They will retain their original formatting as they are not processed by the `jq -S . $i >a.json` command. This means that these specific files will remain unaltered, potentially preserving any custom formatting or configurations that are specific to these files.
