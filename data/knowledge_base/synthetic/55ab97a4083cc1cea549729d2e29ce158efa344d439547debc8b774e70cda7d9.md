**Question:** What is the formula used to calculate the number of Pythia8 events to be embedded into the background event simulation?

**Answer:** The formula used to calculate the number of Pythia8 events to be embedded into the background event simulation is "0.002 * x", where x represents the number of primary particles in the background event.

**Question:** What modifications are made to the Diamond detector's position and width in the background event simulation, and how are these changes specified in the configuration command?

**Answer:** The Diamond detector's position and width are modified in the background event simulation. The position along the z-axis (position[2]) is adjusted to 0.1, and the width along the z-axis (width[2]) is set to 0.05. These changes are specified in the configuration command using the --configKeyValues flag, with the specific modifications written as "Diamond.position[2]=0.1;Diamond.width[2]=0.05".
