**Question:** What is the purpose of the `extract_and_flatten` function in the O2DPG release validation script?

**Answer:** The `extract_and_flatten` function in the O2DPG release validation script is utilized to process and simplify complex data structures, extracting relevant information and presenting it in a more accessible format. This function likely plays a crucial role in analyzing and validating the results of the O2DPG simulations, making it easier to identify any discrepancies or issues.

**Question:** What does the `extract_and_flatten` function do in the `o2dpg_release_validation` module?

**Answer:** The `extract_and_flatten` function in the `o2dpg_release_validation` module is used to extract data and flatten it for analysis or processing in the context of O2DPG and O2 simulation validation.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `extract_and_flatten` function imported from `o2dpg_release_validation` and how does it contribute to the overall functionality of the script?

**Answer:** The `extract_and_flatten` function is imported from the `o2dpg_release_validation` module to help process and organize data for analysis. It plays a crucial role in the script by extracting relevant information and flattening it into a more manageable structure. This process allows the script to efficiently work with the data, facilitating the validation and comparison of release versions in the O2 framework. By flattening the data, it simplifies the handling of nested structures, making subsequent processing and analysis tasks more straightforward and effective.

**Question:** What action is taken if the `args.labels` list is not provided when calling the `run` function?

**Answer:** If the `args.labels` list is not provided when calling the `run` function, the code will generate labels automatically using the template `label_{i}` where `i` is the index of the input file in the list.

---

**Question:** What happens if the number of input files does not match the number of labels provided?

**Answer:** If the number of input files does not match the number of labels provided, the program will print an error message stating "ERROR: Number of input files and labels is different, must be the same" and return 1.

---

**Question:** What specific actions are taken if the number of input files does not match the number of labels provided, and how does this affect the execution of the `run` function?

**Answer:** If the number of input files does not match the number of labels provided, the `run` function will print an error message stating "ERROR: Number of input files and labels is different, must be the same" and return 1, effectively terminating the execution of the function.

---

**Question:** What does the function `main` do if no output directory is specified?

**Answer:** If no output directory is specified, the function `main` sets the output directory to "overlayPlots".

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the reference file is not provided when running the script?

**Answer:** If the reference file is not provided when running the script, the script sets `ref_file` to the value of `config["path"]`.

---

**Question:** What specific steps are taken if the reference file is not provided when extracting configurations from the input files, and how does this affect the output configurations list?

**Answer:** If the reference file is not provided, it is set to the value stored in the configuration dictionary under the key "path". This ensures that the reference file can still be determined even if it was not explicitly passed as an argument. As a result, the output configurations list, `out_configs`, will include the configuration extracted from the input files, with the reference file being set accordingly.
