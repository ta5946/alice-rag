**Question:** What is the purpose of the `mapShifts` associative array in the given script, and how might it be used to manage shifts for objects in the ALICE O2 simulation environment?

**Answer:** The `mapShifts` associative array is declared to store mappings between object identifiers and their corresponding shifts in the ALICE O2 simulation environment. This array facilitates the organization and tracking of different object shifts, making it easier to manipulate and access shift-related information for various objects. It can be used to efficiently manage shift configurations by allowing quick lookups and updates. For example, entries in the array might associate a specific object ID with the shift duration, start time, or any other relevant shift parameters. This approach simplifies the handling of shift schedules and allows for dynamic adjustments and retrievals of shift-related data as needed in the simulation.

**Question:** What is the value of the TPC cluster time shift for run number 529674, and how is it used to calculate the TPCCLUSTERTIMESHIFT export variable?

**Answer:** The value of the TPC cluster time shift for run number 529674 is 22. This value is used to calculate the TPCCLUSTERTIMESHIFT export variable through the following steps:

1. The script checks if the key `529674` exists in the `mapShifts` array.
2. Since the key `529674` is present, the script sets `SHIFTINTIMEBINS` to `22`.
3. The TPCCLUSTERTIMESHIFT variable is then calculated as `22 / -8` using `bc` for floating-point arithmetic, with the result rounded to three decimal places.
