**Question:** What is the sequence of sorting for PRs when using the `o2dpg_make_github_pr_report.py` tool, and which timestamp is used for each state?

**Answer:** The sequence of sorting for PRs when using the `o2dpg_make_github_pr_report.py` tool is as follows:

1. First, PRs are sorted by their state, starting with:
   - Closed and Merged
   - Just Closed
   - Open

2. Within each state category, PRs are grouped by the assigned labels.

3. For the `closed` and `merged` states, the sorting is based on the `merged_at` timestamp.

4. For the `closed` but not `merged` state, the sorting is based on the `updated_at` timestamp.

5. For the `open` state, the sorting is based on the `updated_at` timestamp.

**Question:** What is the specific sorting order for PRs in the report generated by `o2dpg_make_github_pr_report.py` based on their state and when they were last updated?

**Answer:** The specific sorting order for PRs in the report generated by `o2dpg_make_github_pr_report.py` based on their state and last update time is as follows:

1. First, PRs are sorted by their state, dividing them into three categories: `closed and merged`, `closed and not merged`, and `open`.

2. Within each state category, PRs are grouped by the labels they have been assigned.

3. For PRs in the `closed and merged` category, they are further sorted by `merged_at`.

4. For PRs in the `closed and not merged` category, they are sorted by `updated_at`.

5. For PRs in the `open` category, they are sorted by `updated_at`.
