**Question:** What is the default value for the number of signal events if not specified?

**Answer:** The default value for the number of signal events, if not specified, is 1.

**Question:** What specific generator function is used for signal events in this simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The specific generator function used for signal events in this simulation workflow is GeneratorCocktailPromptCharmoniaToMuonEvtGen_PbPb5TeV(), which is defined in the file GeneratorCocktailPromptCharmoniaToMuonEvtGen_PbPb5TeV.C located in ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/config/PWGDQ/external/generator.

**Question:** What specific generator and configuration are used for the signal events in this simulation workflow, and how are background events handled?

**Answer:** The signal events in this simulation workflow use the external generator, specifically the generator cocktail for prompt charmonia decays to muons, configured with the function GeneratorCocktailPromptCharmoniaToMuonEvtGen_PbPb5TeV. The configuration is defined by the key "GeneratorExternal.fileName" pointing to ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/config/PWGDQ/external/generator/GeneratorCocktailPromptCharmoniaToMuonEvtGen_PbPb5TeV.C and "GeneratorExternal.funcName" set to GeneratorCocktailPromptCharmoniaToMuonEvtGen_PbPb5TeV().

Background events are handled by using the pythia8 generator and processing them with the heavy_ion configuration for PbPb collisions. The number of background events is specified by the variable NBKGEVENTS. The simulation also includes embedding of background events and detailed assessments for MFT and FwdMatching, with training data saved for FwdMatching.
