**Question:** What is the default value of the `NSIGEVENTS` variable if not specified?

**Answer:** The default value of the `NSIGEVENTS` variable is 10 if not specified.

---

**Question:** What is the default value of the `NP` parameter in the script, and what does this parameter represent in the context of the simulation?

**Answer:** The default value of the `NP` parameter in the script is 1. This parameter represents the number of particles per event in the context of the simulation.

---

**Question:** What is the effect of the `GAP` variable on the `CONFIGNAME` string in the script, and how does this impact the simulation configuration?

**Answer:** The `GAP` variable influences the `CONFIGNAME` string by including its value in the configuration name, specifically in the format `GapTriggered_LFee_all_np${NP}_gap${GAP}.ini`. This impacts the simulation configuration by ensuring that the configuration file name reflects the gap value being used, which is relevant for the simulation setup, particularly for gap-triggered configurations.
