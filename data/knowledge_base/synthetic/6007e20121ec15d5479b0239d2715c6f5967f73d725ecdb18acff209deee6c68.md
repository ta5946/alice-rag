**Question:** What is the purpose of using the `--aggregate-timeframe 10` option in the o2-sim-dpl-eventgen command?

**Answer:** The `--aggregate-timeframe 10` option in the `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` command is used to combine 10 generated events into a single timeframe. This combined timeframe is then processed and converted into AOD tables, which are a format suitable for further analysis in the O2 framework. This aggregation helps in managing the event data more efficiently by reducing the overhead associated with individual events, making the subsequent analysis tasks more performant.
