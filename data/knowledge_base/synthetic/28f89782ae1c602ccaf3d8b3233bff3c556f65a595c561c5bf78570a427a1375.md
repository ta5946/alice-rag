**Question:** What is the default value for the number of signal events (NSIGEVENTS) if not specified?

**Answer:** The default value for the number of signal events (NSIGEVENTS) if not specified is 20.

**Question:** What is the range of pT_hat values for the highest pt hat bin, and what special value is used to indicate an open bin?

**Answer:** The range of pT_hat values for the highest pt hat bin is from 84 to an open bin indicated by -1.

---

**Question:** What specific conditions must be met for the PTHATBIN variable to be automatically set to 6 in the script, and how does this affect the pT hard bin edges?

**Answer:** The PTHATBIN variable will be automatically set to 6 in the script if no value is provided for it and the default value is not changed. When PTHATBIN is set to 6, the pT hard bin edges will be as follows:

- Lower edge of the first bin: 5.0
- Lower edge of the second bin: 11.0
- Lower edge of the third bin: 21.0
- Lower edge of the fourth bin: 36.0
- Lower edge of the fifth bin: 57.0
- Lower edge of the sixth bin: 84.0

For the sixth (and final) bin, the upper edge is set to -1, indicating an open upper limit. This means the upper edge of the sixth bin will include all pT values above 84.0.

**Question:** What happens if the `PARTICLE_ACCEPTANCE` environment variable is not set when the script runs?

**Answer:** If the `PARTICLE_ACCEPTANCE` environment variable is not set when the script runs, the script will output the message "Detector acceptance option (env. var. PARTICLE_ACCEPTANCE) not set, abort." and exit with a status of 1.

---

**Question:** What will happen if the environment variable `PARTICLE_ACCEPTANCE` is not set when the script is executed?

**Answer:** If the environment variable `PARTICLE_ACCEPTANCE` is not set when the script is executed, the script will output the message "Detector acceptance option (env. var. PARTICLE_ACCEPTANCE) not set, abort." and then exit with a status of 1.

---

**Question:** What happens if the `PARTICLE_ACCEPTANCE` environment variable is not set, and how is the parton PDG flavor configured in the script?

**Answer:** If the `PARTICLE_ACCEPTANCE` environment variable is not set, the script will print "Detector acceptance option (env. var. PARTICLE_ACCEPTANCE) not set, abort." and then exit with status code 1.

The parton PDG flavor is configured using the `CONFIG_OUTPARTON_PDG` environment variable. If this variable is not set, it defaults to 0.

---

**Question:** What does the command `echo 'Parton PDG option ' $CONFIG_OUTPARTON_PDG` print?

**Answer:** The command `echo 'Parton PDG option ' $CONFIG_OUTPARTON_PDG` prints the value of the `CONFIG_OUTPARTON_PDG` configuration option, prefixed by the string 'Parton PDG option '.

**Question:** What specific trigger configuration is used in the workflow for detecting prompt gamma rays?

**Answer:** The specific trigger configuration used in the workflow for detecting prompt gamma rays is set to "external" and is defined in the file "\$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/config/PWGGAJE/ini/trigger_prompt_gamma.ini".

---

**Question:** What specific trigger configuration is used for the simulation, and how is it specified in the workflow script?

**Answer:** The specific trigger configuration used for the simulation is "external". This trigger configuration is specified in the workflow script using the `-trigger "external"` argument in the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` command.
