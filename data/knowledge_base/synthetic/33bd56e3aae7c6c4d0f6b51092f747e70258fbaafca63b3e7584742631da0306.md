**Question:** What does the script do if the WORKFLOWMODE variable is set to "print"?

**Answer:** If the WORKFLOWMODE variable is set to "print", the script will output the workflow command to the console. It will then print the workflow content, formatting it by replacing each instance of " | " with a newline and pipe symbol, effectively making each step of the workflow appear on a new line for better readability.

**Question:** What is the purpose of using `eval` in the workflow execution section of the script?

**Answer:** In the workflow execution section of the script, `eval` is used to interpret and execute the command string stored in the `WORKFLOW` variable. This allows for the dynamic construction and execution of complex command-line instructions, including any flags or arguments that may have been appended to the `WORKFLOW` variable. By using `eval`, the script can adaptively handle various workflow modes and configurations, ensuring that the correct command is executed based on the specific conditions and inputs provided.

**Question:** What would happen if the `WORKFLOWMODE_FILE` variable is empty and the `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "print"?

**Answer:** If the `WORKFLOWMODE_FILE` variable is empty and `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "print", the script would execute the following steps:

1. The `if` condition is evaluated, checking if `WORKFLOWMODE` equals "print".
2. Since "print" matches the condition, the script enters the `then` block.
3. The script prints "Workflow command:".
4. The `WORKFLOW` variable content is echoed, with any instances of `| *` replaced by `|` followed by a newline (`\n`).
5. No command is executed because the `else` block is not entered.

No action is taken with `WORKFLOWMODE_FILE` since the condition does not require it to be non-empty.
