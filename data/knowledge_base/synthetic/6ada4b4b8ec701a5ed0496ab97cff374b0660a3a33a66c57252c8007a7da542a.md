**Question:** What is the purpose of the `O2_SIM_WORKFLOW_RUNNER` script and how does it interact with the `workflow.json` file?

**Answer:** The `O2_SIM_WORKFLOW_RUNNER` script is designed to execute the simulation workflow defined in the `workflow.json` file. It interacts with `workflow.json` by reading the configuration specified in this file to run the simulation. Specifically, it uses the `-f` option to point to `workflow.json`, which contains details about the simulation setup, such as detector configurations, event parameters, and other settings. The `--cpu-limit` option ensures that the simulation runs with a specified number of workers, as defined by the `NWORKERS` variable. This allows for parallel execution of the simulation tasks, improving efficiency and performance.

**Question:** What is the default value of the `SIMENGINE` variable if not specified when running the script?

**Answer:** The default value of the `SIMENGINE` variable if not specified when running the script is TGeant4.
