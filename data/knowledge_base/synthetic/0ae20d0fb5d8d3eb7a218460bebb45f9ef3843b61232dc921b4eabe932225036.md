**Question:** What are the possible values for the `DDMODE` variable and what do they represent in the context of data distribution?

**Answer:** The possible values for the `DDMODE` variable are:

- processing: Indicates that data should be processed as it is distributed.
- disk: Suggests that data is stored on disk for later processing.
- processing-disk: Combines processing and disk operations, meaning data is both processed and stored on disk.
- discard: Specifies that data should not be retained and can be discarded after processing.

**Question:** What would be the impact on the workflow if the `RECO_NUM_NODES_OVERRIDE` is set to a non-zero value?

**Answer:** Setting the `RECO_NUM_NODES_OVERRIDE` to a non-zero value would override the default number of EPN compute nodes specified in the description library file, effectively changing the number of nodes the workflow will use for processing. This could impact the workflow's performance, resource utilization, and overall efficiency, as the chosen number of nodes might not be optimal for the specific task or dataset being processed.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS`, `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC`, and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_CALIB` variables in the configuration settings?

**Answer:** The `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS`, `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC`, and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_CALIB` variables in the configuration settings are used to specify which detectors the workflow should process or monitor. Specifically:

- `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` is an optional parameter that indicates which detectors the workflow should run reconstruction for. The value should be a comma-separated list of detector names. In this configuration, it is set to "FT0", meaning the workflow will process data from the FT0 detector.

- `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC` is another optional parameter that specifies which detectors the workflow should run quality control checks for. Similar to `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS`, it also takes a comma-separated list of detector names. Here, it is also set to "FT0", indicating quality checks will be performed for the FT0 detector.

- `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_CALIB` is an optional parameter for specifying which detectors the workflow should run calibration procedures for. Unlike the other two, it is left empty in this configuration, implying that no calibration procedures are to be run for any detector.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `MULTIPLICITY_FACTOR` variables in the script?

**Answer:** The `MULTIPLICITY_FACTOR` variables in the script are used to scale the number of raw decoders, CTF encoders, and other processes. Specifically, `MULTIPLICITY_FACTOR_RAWDECODERS` controls the scaling for raw decoders, `MULTIPLICETY_FACTOR_CTFENCODERS` for CTF encoders, and `MULTIPLICITY_FACTOR_REST` for all other processes. Each is set to 1 by default, meaning no scaling is applied unless modified.
