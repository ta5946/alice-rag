**Question:** What is the purpose of the `o2-tpc-calib-laser-tracks` workflow step and what does the `--use-filtered-tracks` option do?

**Answer:** The `o2-tpc-calib-laser-tracks` workflow step is intended for calibrating laser tracks in the TPC (Time Projection Chamber) by utilizing tracks that have been filtered through a specific process. The `--use-filtered-tracks` option ensures that only tracks which have passed certain criteria or been filtered in a predefined manner are used for the calibration process. This filtering step likely helps in refining the track data to be more suitable for calibration purposes, potentially by removing noise or irrelevant data points.
