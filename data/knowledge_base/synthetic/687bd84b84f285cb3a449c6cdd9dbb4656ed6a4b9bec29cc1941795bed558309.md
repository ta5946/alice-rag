**Question:** What is the purpose of the script as described in the comment?

**Answer:** The purpose of the script, as described in the comment, is to execute the crmc command with specific parameters, and ensure that it does not write to standard out except for the HepMC event record.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in this script?

**Answer:** The `sed` command in this script is used to filter the output of the `crmc` command, specifically to ensure that only lines starting with "HepMC::" or "[EAUWVP] " are printed. This filtering helps in isolating the HepMC event record from the rest of the output, which is important for the script's intended purpose of processing only the HepMC event records without writing to standard out, as mandated by the comment at the beginning of the script.

**Question:** What specific preprocessing step is applied to the HepMC event record output by the script, and why is this step necessary?

**Answer:** The script applies a preprocessing step using `sed` to filter the output of the HepMC event record. Specifically, `sed -n 's/^\(HepMC::\|[EAUWVP] \)/\1/p'` is used to retain only lines that start with `HepMC::` or with `[EAUWVP] `.

This step is necessary to ensure that only relevant information from the HepMC event record is processed, while removing any extraneous or header information that might be present. This filtering allows for a more focused and cleaner output, which can be beneficial for further analysis or processing of the event data.
