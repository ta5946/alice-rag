## Content

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `SOURCE_GUARD_SETENV` variable in this script?

**Answer:** The `SOURCE_GUARD_SETENV` variable serves as a flag to prevent the script from sourcing itself multiple times. If the variable is not already set, indicating the script has not been sourced before, it initializes the variable and proceeds to source the `gen_topo_helper_functions.sh` script.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `SOURCE_GUARD_SETENV` variable and how does it prevent sourcing the file multiple times?

**Answer:** The `SOURCE_GUARD_SETENV` variable is used to act as a guard against sourcing the file multiple times. When the script is first executed, `SOURCE_GUARD_SETENV` is not set, allowing the script to proceed and set the variable to 1. This prevents the file from being sourced again in subsequent executions, thereby avoiding redundant processing and potential errors.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `SOURCE_GUARD_SETENV` variable and how does it prevent the file from being sourced multiple times?

**Answer:** The `SOURCE_GUARD_SETENV` variable is utilized to act as a flag that indicates whether this script file has already been sourced. If the variable is not set, implying it is the first time the script is being sourced, the script proceeds to set `SOURCE_GUARD_SETENV` to 1, effectively marking it as sourced. This prevents the script from being sourced multiple times, which could lead to redundant or incorrect configurations being applied. If the script is sourced again, the check against `SOURCE_GUARD_SETENV` will fail, and the script will not execute its main body, thus ensuring that the file's content is only processed once.

---

**Question:** What is the minimum number of files that the script attempts to open?

**Answer:** The script attempts to open a minimum of 4096 files.

---

**Question:** What are the steps taken to ensure the number of open files is set to at least 4096, and what action is taken if the limit cannot be set accordingly?

**Answer:** To ensure the number of open files is set to at least 4096, the script first checks if `SETENV_NO_ULIMIT` is not set to 1. If this condition is true, it sets the soft limit for the maximum number of open files (`-n`) to 4096 using `ulimit -S -n 4096`, and ensures the maximum memory limit (`-m`), maximum virtual memory size (`-v`), and maximum number of processes (`-l`) are set to unlimited. If `GPUTYPE` is not set or is "CPU", it sets the maximum number of processes to unlimited.

If the `ulimit` command fails (indicated by a non-zero exit status), the script outputs an error message and exits with a status of 1.

If `SETENV_NO_ULIMIT` is set to 1, the script retrieves the current soft (`-n`) and hard (`-H`) limits for the maximum number of open files. It then sets a requirement of 4000 for these limits. If the hard limit is greater than the soft limit and the soft limit is less than the requirement, it adjusts the soft limit to the maximum of 4000 and the hard limit.

The script then checks the final soft limit for the maximum number of open files. If this limit is less than the requirement, it outputs a warning message indicating that the limit could not be raised to the required value, and the current limit is used instead.

---

**Question:** What is the minimum value of the file descriptor limit (`ulimit -n`) required to be set for this script to function correctly, and how does the script ensure this limit is met?

**Answer:** The minimum value of the file descriptor limit (`ulimit -n`) required to be set for this script to function correctly is 4000. The script first attempts to set the soft limit (`ulimit -S -n`) to 4096 and the hard limit (`ulimit -H -n`) to `unlimited`. If the hard limit is not `unlimited`, it is set to 4000. If the hard limit is greater than the soft limit and the soft limit is less than 4000, the script raises the soft limit to the value of the hard limit or 4000, whichever is lower. The script then checks if the final limit (`ulimit -n`) is less than 4000. If it is, a warning message is output to stderr indicating the limit could not be raised to the required value.

---

**Question:** What is the value of the environment variable `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` if it is not set?

**Answer:** The value of the environment variable `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` if it is not set is $LIST_OF_DETECTORS, which expands to "ITS,MFT,TPC,TOF,FT0,MID,EMC,PHS,CPV,ZDC,FDD,HMP,FV0,TRD,MCH,CTP".

---

**Question:** What are the default detectors included in the workflow if neither WORKFLOW_DETECTORS nor any exclusion variables are set?

**Answer:** The default detectors included in the workflow, if neither WORKFLOW_DETECTORS nor any exclusion variables are set, are all the detectors listed in the LIST_OF_DETECTORS. These are: ITS, MFT, TPC, TOF, FT0, MID, EMC, PHS, CPV, ZDC, FDD, HMP, FV0, TRD, MCH, and CTP.

---

**Question:** What specific detector combinations are used in the WORKFLOW_DETECTORS variable if neither WORKFLOW_DETECTORS nor WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE is set, and how does excluding certain detectors through WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE affect the final list of detectors in WORKFLOW_DETECTORS?

**Answer:** If neither WORKFLOW_DETECTORS nor WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE is set, the WORKFLOW_DETECTORS variable is assigned the value of $LIST_OF_DETECTORS, which includes: ITS, MFT, TPC, TOF, FT0, MID, EMC, PHS, CPV, ZDC, FDD, HMP, FV0, TRD, MCH, and CTP.

Excluding certain detectors through WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE affects the final list of detectors in WORKFLOW_DETECTORS by removing the specified detectors from the initial list. For each detector specified in WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE, the variable's value is modified to exclude that detector. This is achieved using a loop that iterates over each detector in WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE, and for each iteration, the value of WORKFLOW_DETECTORS is updated to remove the specified detector. The updates are made by applying sed commands to the current value of WORKFLOW_DETECTORS. Specifically, the commands remove occurrences of the specified detector at the beginning, end, or in the middle of the list, ensuring that the detector is completely removed from WORKFLOW_DETECTORS.

---

**Question:** What is the default value assigned to the WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_GPU variable if it is not already set?

**Answer:** The default value assigned to the WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_GPU variable if it is not already set is "TPC".

---

**Question:** What is the default value assigned to `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_FLP_PROCESSING` if it is not set, and how does this value get assigned to other detector-related environment variables if they are not set?

**Answer:** The default value assigned to `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_FLP_PROCESSING` if it is not set is "ALL". This value is then assigned to other detector-related environment variables (`WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC`, `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_CALIB`, `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_RECO`, and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_CTF`) if they are not set by checking if the variable is unset or if it equals "ALL".

---

**Question:** What is the default value of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_RECO` variable if it is not defined, and how does it relate to the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` variable?

**Answer:** The default value of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_RECO` variable is set to be equal to the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` variable if `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_RECO` is not defined or if its value is "0ALL".

---

**Question:** What will be the value of `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` if `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` is set to "ALL" and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` is not defined?

**Answer:** The value of `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` will be set to "ALL".

---

**Question:** What is the value of `WORKFLOW_PARAMETERS` after the given script segment is executed if it was not set before?

**Answer:** The value of `WORKFLOW_PARAMETERS` after the given script segment is executed, if it was not set before, is an empty string `;`.

---

**Question:** What is the significance of the double "0" at the beginning of the condition in the first line of the script, and how does it affect the value of `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` when `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` is not set?

**Answer:** The double "0" at the beginning of the condition in the first line of the script serves to ensure that the variable `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` is treated as a string, even if it is empty. This is important because without the "0", if the variable is empty, the expression would be evaluated as a boolean false, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

When `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` is not set, the expression `0${WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER:-}` evaluates to "0". The `${parameter:-}` construct provides a default value if the parameter is unset or null. In this case, it means that if `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` is not set, `${WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER:-}` is equivalent to an empty string, and thus `0${WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER:-}` becomes "0".

The script then checks if "0${WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER:-}" equals "0ALL". If it does, the value of `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` is set to the value of `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS`. If it does not, the value of `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` remains unchanged from its original state (or the default empty string if it was not set).

In summary, the double "0" ensures the condition treats the variable correctly as a string, and the value of `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER` is set to `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` only when it is not "0ALL", ensuring proper handling of unset variables.

---

**Question:** What does the script do if the environment variable `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_QC` is set?

**Answer:** If the environment variable `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_QC` is set, the script iterates through its contents separated by commas. For each item in the list, it modifies the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC` variable by removing occurrences of the item from it. This is achieved using `sed` to perform multiple string replacements: removing the item from the beginning, middle, and end of the list, while also eliminating any double commas that might result from these operations.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_QC` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_CALIB` environment variables in the given script?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_QC` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_CALIB` environment variables in the given script is to exclude specific detectors from the quality control (QC) and calibration workflows, respectively. When these variables are not empty, the script iterates over the listed detectors and removes them from the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_CALIB` environment variables. This is achieved by using `sed` commands to modify the comma-separated lists stored in these variables, effectively removing the specified detectors.

---

**Question:** What is the effect of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_QC` environment variable on the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC` variable, and how does the script ensure that the modifications are applied correctly?

**Answer:** The `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_QC` environment variable is used to exclude specific detectors from the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC` variable. If `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_QC` is not empty, the script iterates over each detector listed in it (separated by commas) and removes these detectors from `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC`. The script ensures this by using `sed` commands to modify the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC` variable:

1. `s/,$i,/,/g` - Removes the comma preceding the detector `i` if it exists.
2. `s/^$i,//` - Removes the comma following the detector `i` if it exists at the beginning.
3. `s/,$i'$'//` - Removes the detector `i` and the trailing comma if it exists.
4. `s/^$i'$'//` - Removes the detector `i` and the leading comma if it exists.

This process is repeated for each detector in `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_QC`, ensuring that `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_QC` is correctly updated to exclude the specified detectors.

---

**Question:** What is the default value of the `SEVERITY` variable if it is not set?

**Answer:** The default value of the `SEVERITY` variable is "info" if it is not set.

---

**Question:** What would be the value of the `FILEWORKDIRRUN` variable if the `FILEWORKDIR` variable is not set when the script is executed?

**Answer:** The value of the `FILEWORKDIRRUN` variable would be the same as `FILEWORKDIR`, which in this case would be set to the current working directory (`pwd`) since `FILEWORKDIR` is not explicitly assigned a value and the script uses `pwd` as the default.

---

**Question:** What is the default value of the `WORKFLOWMODE` variable if it is not set, and how many other variables have the same default value handling mechanism?

**Answer:** The default value of the `WORKFLOWMODE` variable is `run` if it is not set. There are 3 other variables (`SEVERITY`, `NORATELOG`, and `INRAWCHANNAME`) that have the same default value handling mechanism.

---

**Question:** What is the significance of the `-z` condition in the given script and how does it affect the `MULTIPLICITY_FACTOR_REST` variable if the `MULTIPLICITY_FACTOR_REST` environment variable is not set?

**Answer:** The `-z` condition checks if the string is empty. If the `MULTIPLICITY_FACTOR_REST` environment variable is not set (meaning it is undefined or has a null value), the `-z` test will return true. Consequently, the script will execute the command to set `MULTIPLICITY_FACTOR_REST` to `1`, ensuring the variable has a defined value. This is useful for scenarios where `MULTIPLICITY_FACTOR_REST` might be absent and a default value is needed.

---

**Question:** What additional processing steps are added to the workflow for synchronous mode, and how are they determined?

**Answer:** For synchronous mode (SYNCMODE = 1), the additional processing step ENTROPY_ENCODER is added to the workflow. This step is directly determined and added based on the value of SYNCMODE without requiring any further conditions or iterations over a list of steps.

---

**Question:** What specific reconstruction steps are added to the workflow for asynchronous mode, and how are they determined based on the input variables?

**Answer:** For asynchronous mode, the specific reconstruction steps added to the workflow are determined by the variable LIST_OF_ASYNC_RECO_STEPS. Each detector step listed in LIST_OF_ASYNC_RECO_STEPS is checked using the has_detector_reco function. If a detector step is present, it is added to the workflow_extra_processing_steps as ${i}_RECO, where i is the detector step identifier. Additionally, the TPC_DEDX step is always added to the workflow_extra_processing_steps regardless of the detector steps listed in LIST_OF_ASYNC_RECO_STEPS.

---

**Question:** What is the order of detectors in the `HMP_SOURCES` variable when all four detectors (HMP, ITS, TPC, TRD, TOF) are present and their respective matching steps are defined?

**Answer:** The order of detectors in the `HMP_SOURCES` variable when all four detectors (HMP, ITS, TPC, TRD, TOF) are present and their respective matching steps are defined is "ITS-TPC-TRD-TOF".

---

**Question:** What is the sequence of detector matching and processing steps for the HMP detector with TPC, TRD, and TOF, and how are the sources for track reconstruction defined?

**Answer:** The sequence of detector matching and processing steps for the HMP detector with TPC, TRD, and TOF involves the following:

1. `has_detectors_reco HMP TPC TRD TOF`
2. `has_detector_matching ITSTPCTRDTOF`
3. `has_detector_matching ITSTPC`
4. `has_detector_matching ITSTRD`
5. `has_detector_matching ITSTOF`
6. `has_detector_matching TPCTRD`
7. `has_detector_matching TPCTRDTOF`
8. `add_comma_separated HMP_SOURCES "ITS-TPC-TRD-TOF"`

The sources for track reconstruction are defined as "ITS-TPC-TRD-TOF".

**Question:** What does the script do if the detector is not recognized by the `has_detector_reco` function?

**Answer:** If the detector is not recognized by the `has_detector_reco` function, the script does nothing for that particular detector and moves on to check the next detector in the loop, if any exist.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `has_detector_reco` function in the given script, and how does it interact with the `TRACK_SOURCES` variable?

**Answer:** The `has_detector_reco` function is used to check if a particular detector is present in the reconstruction process. If this condition is met, the `add_comma_separated` function is called with the argument `TRACK_SOURCES` and the detected detector name. This ensures that the detector name is added to the `TRACK_SOURCES` variable, separated by commas if it's not the first addition. The `TRACK_SOURCES` variable accumulates a list of detector names that contribute to track reconstruction, with each new detector name being appended, possibly preceded by a comma.

---

**Question:** What is the specific condition under which the `has_detector_reco` function is called and how does it interact with the `add_comma_separated` function to manage the `TRACK_SOURCES` variable across different detectors in the ALICE O2 simulation?

**Answer:** The `has_detector_reco` function is called for each detector in the simulation. If the condition `has_detector_reco $det` evaluates to true, the `add_comma_separated` function is invoked with the arguments `TRACK_SOURCES` and the current detector variable `$det`. This process adds the current detector to the `TRACK_SOURCES` string, separated by commas, for each detector that meets the `has_detector_reco` condition. Thus, `TRACK_SOURCES` accumulates the names of detectors that have reconstruction capabilities, ensuring that the variable reflects a comma-separated list of all such detectors encountered during the simulation.

**Question:** What is the value of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` variable if the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` environment variable is set to "0ALL"?

**Answer:** The value of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` variable will be set to the value of the `TRACK_SOURCES` variable if the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` environment variable is set to "0ALL".

---

**Question:** What does the script do if `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` is set to "0ALLSINGLE"?

**Answer:** If `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` is set to "0ALLSINGLE", the script exports `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` as the value of `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS`.

---

**Question:** What is the value of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` environment variable when `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` is set to "0ALLSINGLE" and `TRACK_SOURCES` is defined as "ITS,TPC" in the script?

**Answer:** The value of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` environment variable will be set to "ITS,TPC" when `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` is set to "0ALLSINGLE" and `TRACK_SOURCES` is defined as "ITS,TPC" in the script.

---

**Question:** What does the script do if the environment variable `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` is set?

**Answer:** If the environment variable `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` is set, the script iterates over each item in the comma-separated list it contains. For each item, it modifies the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` variable by removing occurrences of that item. This is achieved using `sed` to perform string manipulations, specifically removing commas around the item and also trimming the item from the beginning or end of the string if it matches exactly.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS` variables in the given script?

**Answer:** The `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS` variables serve to exclude specific detectors from being read by the global reader for tracks and clusters, respectively. The script processes these variables to modify the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS` variables by removing the entries listed in the exclusion variables. This is achieved through a series of sed commands that manipulate the strings, effectively removing the specified detector names from the use list.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS` variables in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation, and how do the provided script segments modify the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS` variables based on these exclusions?

**Answer:** The `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS` variables are used to specify detectors whose global reader tracks or clusters should be excluded from the workflow in the ALICE O2 simulation. 

The provided script segments modify the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS` variables based on the exclusions in these variables. Specifically, for each detector listed in `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS`, the script removes the corresponding entry from `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` by performing the following operations:

1. Replacing instances of the excluded detector separated by commas.
2. Removing leading commas if the excluded detector is at the beginning of the list.
3. Removing trailing commas if the excluded detector is at the end of the list.
4. Removing the excluded detector entirely if it is the only entry in the list.

Similarly, for each detector listed in `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS`, the script performs the same operations on `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_USE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS`.

In summary, the script segments dynamically adjust the list of detectors to include in the global reader workflow based on the exclusions specified in the `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_TRACKS` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_EXCLUDE_GLOBAL_READER_CLUSTERS` variables, ensuring that the workflow does not process the excluded detectors.

**Question:** What does the environment variable `VERTEXING_SOURCES` default to, and how is it used in the script?

**Answer:** The environment variable `VERTEXING_SOURCES` defaults to the value of `TRACK_SOURCES`. In the script, `VERTEXING_SOURCES` is used to conditionally append the `--vertexing-sources` option to `PVERTEX_CONFIG`. Specifically, if `VERTEXING_SOURCES` is not an empty string, the script adds `--vertexing-sources $VERTEXING_SOURCES` to `PVERTEX_CONFIG`.

---

**Question:** What will happen to the `PVERTEX_CONFIG` variable if both `VERTEXING_SOURCES` and `VERTEX_TRACK_MATCHING_SOURCES` are set to empty strings?

**Answer:** If both `VERTEXING_SOURCES` and `VERTEX_TRACK_MATCHING_SOURCES` are set to empty strings, the `PVERTEX_CONFIG` variable will not receive any additional arguments related to vertexing sources or vertex-track matching sources. Specifically, the lines:

```
[[ ! -z $VERTEXING_SOURCES ]] && PVERTEX_CONFIG+=" --vertexing-sources $VERTEXING_SOURCES"
[[ ! -z $VERTEX_TRACK_MATCHING_SOURCES ]] && PVERTEX_CONFIG+=" --vertex-track-matching-sources $VERTEX_TRACK_MATCHING_SOURCES"
```

will not append anything to `PVERTEX_CONFIG`, as the condition `[[ ! -z $VERTEXING_SOURCES ]]` and `[[ ! -z $VERTEX_TRACK_MATCHING_SOURCES ]]` will evaluate to false, and therefore no `--vertexing-sources` or `--vertex-track-matching-sources` options will be added.

**Question:** What modifications would be necessary to the configuration if the FT0 detector were to be added for timing calibration, and how does the current script handle this possibility?

**Answer:** If the FT0 detector were to be added for timing calibration, the current script would require the addition of the `--validate-with-ft0` option to the `PVERTEX_CONFIG` variable. However, the script currently suppresses this option by commenting it out, as it notes that well-calibrated timing between different detectors is required, which is not currently the case. To enable timing validation with FT0, the relevant line should be uncommented, changing

```bash
#has_detector_reco FT0 && PVERTEX_CONFIG+=" --validate-with-ft0"
```

to

```bash
has_detector_reco FT0 && PVERTEX_CONFIG+=" --validate-with-ft0"
```

**Question:** How many input types can be set simultaneously according to the script?

**Answer:** According to the script, only one of the input types (EXTINPUT, CTFINPUT, RAWTFINPUT, DIGITINPUT) can be set simultaneously. Setting more than one leads to an error message and termination of the script.

---

**Question:** What conditions would cause the script to print "Invalid workflow mode" and exit?

**Answer:** The script would print "Invalid workflow mode" and exit if the value of the WORKFLOWMODE variable is not set to "run", "print", "dds", or "dump".

**Question:** What is the consequence of setting both `SAVECTF` to 1 and `CTFINPUT` to 1 simultaneously in the given script?

**Answer:** The consequence of setting both `SAVECTF` to 1 and `CTFINPUT` to 1 simultaneously in the given script is that it triggers an error message stating "SAVECTF and CTFINPUT are incompatible" and exits with status code 1.
