**Question:** What is the probability that the "GeneratorHFGapTriggered_BeautyForcedDecay_Gap3.ini" configuration will be used?

**Answer:** The probability that the "GeneratorHFGapTriggered_BeautyForcedDecay_Gap3.ini" configuration will be used is 20%. This is determined by the condition `if [[ $RNDSIG -ge 20 && $RNDSIG -lt 40 ]]`, where $RNDSIG is a random number between 0 and 99, inclusive.
