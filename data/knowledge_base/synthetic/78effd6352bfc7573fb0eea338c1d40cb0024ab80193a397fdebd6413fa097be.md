**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--field ccdb` option in the simulation command?

**Answer:** The `--field ccdb` option in the simulation command is used to indicate that the simulation should interact with the CCDB (Common Conditions DB) service. This interaction is likely for retrieving or storing calibration and other conditions data that are relevant for the simulation, ensuring that the generated events are consistent with the current operational conditions of the detector.

**Question:** How many workers are specified to run in parallel for the simulation, and what is the purpose of using multiple workers in this context?

**Answer:** 8 workers are specified to run in parallel for the simulation. The purpose of using multiple workers is to produce events faster, as stated in the document where it mentions that these multiple clones are running in parallel.

**Question:** What specific configuration key is used to set the number of workers for parallel processing in the hybrid generator, and what is its value in this simulation script?

**Answer:** The specific configuration key used to set the number of workers for parallel processing in the hybrid generator is "GeneratorHybrid.num_workers". Its value in this simulation script is 8.
