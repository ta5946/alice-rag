**Question:** How many workers are specified to run in parallel for the simulation, and what is the purpose of using multiple workers in this context?

**Answer:** 8 workers are specified to run in parallel for the simulation. The purpose of using multiple workers is to produce events faster, as stated in the document where it mentions that these multiple clones are running in parallel.
