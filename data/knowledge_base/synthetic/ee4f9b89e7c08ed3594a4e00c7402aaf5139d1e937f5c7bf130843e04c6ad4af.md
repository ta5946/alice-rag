## Content

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `TFileMerger` class in this script?

**Answer:** The `TFileMerger` class in this script is used to merge multiple ROOT files into a single output file. It iterates through the input files provided, checks their existence, and adds them to the merger. Once all input files are added, the merged content is written to the specified output file.

**Question:** What actions would be taken if any of the input files specified in the command line do not exist?

**Answer:** If any of the input files specified in the command line do not exist, a message "Fatal: {input_file} does not exist." will be printed, and the script will exit with a status code of 1.

---

**Question:** What specific actions would you take if the input file list contains a file that does not exist, and how does the script handle this situation?

**Answer:** If the input file list contains a file that does not exist, the script will print the message "Fatal: [file_name] does not exist." and exit with a status code of 1. This is handled by checking the existence of each input file before adding it to the merger.

---

**Question:** What will happen if the merging process fails according to the provided code snippet?

**Answer:** If the merging process fails, the code will print "Error: Merging failed." and exit with status code 2.

---

**Question:** What will happen if the merging process fails, and how does the script handle a successful merge?

**Answer:** If the merging process fails, the script will print "Error: Merging failed." and exit with a status code of 2. If the merge is successful, the script will print a message indicating that the files have been successfully merged into the specified output file and will exit with a status code of 0.

---

**Question:** What are the potential consequences if the merging process fails, and how does the code handle this scenario in relation to the exit status and error messaging?

**Answer:** If the merging process fails, the code will print an error message: "Error: Merging failed." and then call `sys.exit(2)` to terminate the program with a non-zero exit status, indicating an error occurred. On the other hand, if the merging process succeeds, the code will print a success message indicating the output file and then call `sys.exit(0)` to terminate the program with a zero exit status, signifying normal termination.
