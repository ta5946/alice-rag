**Question:** What is the purpose of the `-procBkg` option in the O2 simulation workflow command and what does it specify?

**Answer:** The `-procBkg` option in the O2 simulation workflow command is used to specify the process for background events. It is set to `inel` in the provided configuration, which indicates that the background events are to be processed as inelastic events. This means that the simulation will include inelastic background interactions in addition to the primary signal events, enhancing the realism of the simulated dataset by accounting for potential non-collision backgrounds that might be present in real experiments.
