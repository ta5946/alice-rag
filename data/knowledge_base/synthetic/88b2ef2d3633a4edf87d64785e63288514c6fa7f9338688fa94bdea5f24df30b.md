**Question:** What is the purpose of the `ARGS_EXTRA_PROCESS_o2_raw_tf_reader_workflow` environment variable in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation, and how does it affect the processing of raw data from all detectors?

**Answer:** The `ARGS_EXTRA_PROCESS_o2_raw_tf_reader_workflow` environment variable serves to specify additional command-line arguments for the o2_raw_tf_reader_workflow process in the ALICE O2 simulation. In this context, it is set to `--raw-only-det all`, which indicates that only raw data from all detectors should be processed. This setting ensures that the workflow focuses solely on reading and handling raw data without any further processing steps typically applied to reconstructed or calibrated data. As a result, the processing of raw data from all detectors, including the CPV, is isolated and unaffected by other workflow stages, allowing for a dedicated raw data handling process that can be used for initial data analysis, quality checks, or feeding into other parts of the simulation workflow that specifically require raw data.
