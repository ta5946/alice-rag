**Question:** What is the value of the environment variable `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS`?

**Answer:** The value of the environment variable `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` is "CPV".

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `ARGS_EXTRA_PROCESS_o2_raw_tf_reader_workflow` environment variable in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation, and how does it affect the processing of raw data from all detectors?

**Answer:** The `ARGS_EXTRA_PROCESS_o2_raw_tf_reader_workflow` environment variable serves to specify additional command-line arguments for the o2_raw_tf_reader_workflow process in the ALICE O2 simulation. In this context, it is set to `--raw-only-det all`, which indicates that only raw data from all detectors should be processed. This setting ensures that the workflow focuses solely on reading and handling raw data without any further processing steps typically applied to reconstructed or calibrated data. As a result, the processing of raw data from all detectors, including the CPV, is isolated and unaffected by other workflow stages, allowing for a dedicated raw data handling process that can be used for initial data analysis, quality checks, or feeding into other parts of the simulation workflow that specifically require raw data.

**Question:** What specific combination of environment variables is required to configure the O2 raw TF reader workflow to process all detectors in raw-only mode, and how does this configuration differ from the one used for the CPV detector alone?

**Answer:** To configure the O2 raw TF reader workflow to process all detectors in raw-only mode, the following environment variables must be set:

```bash
export WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_CTF="ALL" 
export WORKFLOW_DETECTORS="ALL"
export ARGS_EXTRA_PROCESS_o2_raw_tf_reader_workflow=" --raw-only-det all "
```

This configuration differs from the one used for the CPV detector alone in that `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS_CTF` and `WORKFLOW_DETECTORS` are set to "ALL" instead of "CPV", indicating that all detectors should be processed, not just the CPV detector. Additionally, the `ARGS_EXTRA_PROCESS_o2_raw_tf_reader_workflow` includes the `--raw-only-det all` flag, ensuring that all detectors are processed in raw-only mode.
