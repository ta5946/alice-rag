**Question:** What command should you use to rerun CMake if the initial configuration is not correct?

**Answer:** To rerun CMake if the initial configuration is not correct, you should use the command `cmake .`.

**Question:** Which test had the highest execution time according to the summary provided?

**Answer:** The test with the highest execution time according to the summary provided was mid, with 20.33 sec*proc (5 tests).

---

**Question:** What changes were made to the build tree to improve organization, and where are the `bin`, `lib`, and `share` directories now located?

**Answer:** The build tree was organized by introducing a `stage` area where most build artifacts, including the `bin`, `lib`, and `share` directories, are now located instead of directly under the build topdir.

---

**Question:** What are the three critical areas that developers should not focus on during the initial proof-of-concept step of rewriting the main CMakeLists.txt files?

**Answer:** During the initial proof-of-concept step of rewriting the main CMakeLists.txt files, developers should not focus on:
- GPU stuff
- Testing of Root macros
- Getting a proper O2Config.cmake produced (which is related to packaging)

**Question:** What are the main goals of migrating to "modern" CMake practices in the ALICE O2 simulation documentation, and how do they aim to achieve these goals?

**Answer:** The main goals of migrating to "modern" CMake practices in the ALICE O2 simulation documentation are to abandon the bucket system, which has been hiding genuine dependency issues in the build system. To achieve these goals, they aim to base everything on targets and minimize the use of variables and directory-specific functions, following the latest CMake community recommendations.

---

**Question:** What are the current limitations for running ctest, and why is its implementation in a non-alibuild environment deferred?

**Answer:** The current limitation for running ctest is that it must be executed within an alibuild build environment. This is because the macro testing, which is a prerequisite for ctest, is designed to work only in this specific setup. The implementation of ctest in a non-alibuild environment is deferred due to it being a non-trivial task and deviating from the current practices.

**Question:** Which CMake function would you use to add a test that links against multiple executables and libraries defined in the project, and what files in the `cmake` directory would you need to consult for the proper implementation?

**Answer:** To add a test that links against multiple executables and libraries defined in the project, you would use the `o2_add_test` function. This function is documented in the file `../cmake/O2AddTest.cmake`. For a proper implementation, you would also need to consult the `o2_add_executable` and `o2_add_library` functions, which are documented in `../cmake/O2AddExecutable.cmake` and `../cmake/O2AddLibrary.cmake`, respectively.

**Question:** What are the three versions of GPU targets mentioned in the document, and for which detectors are CUDA targets used?

**Answer:** The three versions of GPU targets mentioned are HIP, OpenCL, and CUDA. CUDA targets are used for the TPC and ITS detectors.

---

**Question:** How many JSON files are there in the `codemodel-v2-83681dd2d17b5fde868d.json` directory?

**Answer:** There is 1 JSON file in the `codemodel-v2-83681dd2d17b5fde868d.json` directory.

---

**Question:** What target does the `FindRapidJSON` module define in CMake and what type of library does this target correspond to?

**Answer:** The `FindRapidJSON` module in CMake defines a target named `RapidJSON::RapidJSON` which corresponds to a header-only library.

---

**Question:** What is the primary function of the `FindFairRoot.cmake` file in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation documentation?

**Answer:** The primary function of the `FindFairRoot.cmake` file is to create imported targets, allowing the use of `FairRoot::XXX` targets even if they have not (yet) been created by FairRoot itself. This file is expected to be phased out once FairRoot fully migrates to its own CMake configuration.

---

**Question:** Why did the authors choose to use their own functions instead of sticking to CMake's native functions for creating targets?

**Answer:** The authors chose to use their own functions instead of CMake's native functions for creating targets to avoid repetitive code in their CMakeLists.txt files and to enforce certain conventions more effectively. Using their own functions allowed them to standardize the build process, making it easier to maintain and manage across multiple CMakeLists.txt files.

---

**Question:** What are the primary reasons for avoiding the use of custom variables in the CMakeLists.txt files according to the document?

**Answer:** The primary reasons for avoiding the use of custom variables in the CMakeLists.txt files, according to the document, are that most of these files can be written without any custom variables. While custom variables are not inherently bad, the document suggests that minimizing their use leads to cleaner and more straightforward CMakeLists.txt files.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `[o2_find_dependencies_from_alibuild](../dependencies/O2FindDependenciesFromAliBuild.cmake)` function and in which toolset might it be particularly useful?

**Answer:** The `[o2_find_dependencies_from_alibuild](../dependencies/O2FindDependenciesFromAliBuild.cmake)` function is designed to detect third-party dependencies from an AliBuild installation zone. This toolset is particularly useful for developers utilizing IDEs such as CLion, as it simplifies the process of identifying and managing external dependencies within their projects.

---

**Question:** What changes might be considered in the future regarding the `BUILD_SIMULATION` option, and how is it currently utilized?

**Answer:** The `BUILD_SIMULATION` option is currently utilized "only" to fetch more dependencies. However, there is a consideration to potentially group all the simulation-dependent parts of O2 into an optional component in the future. This option is currently not used for actually including or excluding simulation-related code, but it might evolve in that direction.

---

**Question:** What are the main changes in the `CMakeLists.txt` file that allow developers to run tests from the build tree without installation?

**Answer:** The main changes in the `CMakeLists.txt` file that allow developers to run tests from the build tree without installation include:

- The top `CMakeLists.txt` was rewritten to include testing capabilities directly within the build tree.
- Testing can now be executed using ctest from the build directory, eliminating the need for installation.
- This change ensures that the testing process is more convenient and accessible to developers, facilitating easier testing and development cycles.
