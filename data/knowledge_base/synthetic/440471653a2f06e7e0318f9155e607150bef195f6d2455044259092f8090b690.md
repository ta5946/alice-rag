**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--configFile` option in the o2-sim command, and what configuration file is being used in this script?

**Answer:** The `--configFile` option in the o2-sim command specifies the configuration file to be used for the simulation. In this script, the configuration file being used is:

```
${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/config/examples/ini/trigger_multiplicity_stableparticles_inFIT.ini
```

This configuration file contains the details for the simulation setup, including the trigger multiplicity for stable particles within the FIT acceptance.
