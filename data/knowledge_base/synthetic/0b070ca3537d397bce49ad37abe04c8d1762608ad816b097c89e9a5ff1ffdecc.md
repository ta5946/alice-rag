**Question:** What is the purpose of the PROXY_INSPEC and PROXY_OUTSPEC variables in the script?

**Answer:** The PROXY_INSPEC and PROXY_OUTSPEC variables in the script serve to define the input and output data specifications for data processing in the context of the ALICE O2 simulation framework.

PROXY_INSPEC is set to "A:MFT/RAWDATA;B:FLP/DISTSUBTIMEFRAME/0". This specifies that the input data consists of Raw Data from the MFT (Magnet Field Tracker) and Distributed Subtimeframe Data from the FLP (Fast Tracker). The "A:" and "B:" prefixes likely refer to different sources or types of data streams.

PROXY_OUTSPEC is set to "downstream:MFT/DIGITS/0;downstream:MFT/DIGITSROF/0". This indicates that the output data will contain MFT Digits and DigitsROF (Digits with ROF information) data. The "downstream:" prefix probably signifies that these data products are intended for further downstream processing in the simulation pipeline.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--inject-missing-data` option in the o2-dpl-raw-proxy command?

**Answer:** The `--inject-missing-data` option in the o2-dpl-raw-proxy command is intended to handle cases where data is missing or incomplete, ensuring that the simulation workflow can proceed by filling in or generating placeholder data for those missing sections. This helps maintain the continuity of data processing and analysis, even when some raw data is not available.
