**Question:** What is the size of the global SHMEM allocated in the script?

**Answer:** The size of the global SHMEM allocated in the script is 128 GB.

**Question:** What is the value of the `SHMSIZE` variable and what does it represent in the context of the script?

**Answer:** The value of the `SHMSIZE` variable is `128 GB`. In the context of the script, this variable represents the size of the shared memory (SHMEM) allocated for the global shared memory region, which is crucial for inter-process communication and data exchange in parallel processing environments, particularly in high-performance computing applications like ALICE O2 simulations.

**Question:** What specific conditions must be met for the variable `NUMAGPUIDS` to trigger the addition of the `--child-driver 'numactl --membind $NUMAID --cpunodebind $NUMAID'"` argument to the command-line options?

**Answer:** For the variable `NUMAGPUIDS` to trigger the addition of the `--child-driver 'numactl --membind $NUMAID --cpunodebind $NUMAID'"` argument to the command-line options, it must be non-zero.

**Question:** What is the command used to assemble the workflow in this script?

**Answer:** The command used to assemble the workflow in this script is:

o2-dpl-run ${ARGS_ALL} ${GLOBALDPLOPT}

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `WORKFLOWMODE` variable in the given script, and how does it affect the workflow execution?

**Answer:** The `WORKFLOWMODE` variable in the script determines how the workflow is executed. If `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "print", the script echoes the workflow command without actually executing it. This is useful for debugging or viewing the command that would be run. Otherwise, if `WORKFLOWMODE` is not "print", the script appends `--$WORKFLOWMODE ${WORKFLOWMODE_FILE}` to the `WORKFLOW` string and then executes the assembled command using `eval`. This allows for dynamic workflow execution based on the value of `WORKFLOWMODE`.

---

**Question:** What is the exact command that would be executed when the WORKFLOWMODE is set to "print" and how does it differ from the execution command?

**Answer:** When WORKFLOWMODE is set to "print", the exact command that would be executed is:

```
Workflow command:
add_W o2-dpl-raw-proxy "--dataspec \"$PROXY_INSPEC\" --inject-missing-data --channel-config \"name=readout-proxy,type=pull,method=connect,address=ipc://@tf-builder-pipe-0,transport=shmem,rateLogging=1\"" "" 0
add_W o2-tpc-raw-to-digits-workflow "--ignore-grp --input-spec \"$CALIB_INSPEC\" --remove-duplicates --pipeline tpc-raw-to-digits-0:20" "${EXTRA_CONFIG}"
add_QC_from_consul "${QC_CONFIG_CONSUL}" "--local --host lcoalhost"
o2-dpl-run ${ARGS_ALL} ${GLOBALDPLOPT}
```

This differs from the execution command in that it does not actually run the workflow; instead, it prints the assembled command to the screen. The execution command would involve running the `eval` command with the assembled `WORKFLOW` string appended with `--$WORKFLOWMODE ${WORKFLOWMODE_FILE}`.
