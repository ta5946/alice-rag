**Question:** What is the value of the `SHMSIZE` variable and what does it represent in the context of the script?

**Answer:** The value of the `SHMSIZE` variable is `128 GB`. In the context of the script, this variable represents the size of the shared memory (SHMEM) allocated for the global shared memory region, which is crucial for inter-process communication and data exchange in parallel processing environments, particularly in high-performance computing applications like ALICE O2 simulations.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `WORKFLOWMODE` variable in the given script, and how does it affect the workflow execution?

**Answer:** The `WORKFLOWMODE` variable in the script determines how the workflow is executed. If `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "print", the script echoes the workflow command without actually executing it. This is useful for debugging or viewing the command that would be run. Otherwise, if `WORKFLOWMODE` is not "print", the script appends `--$WORKFLOWMODE ${WORKFLOWMODE_FILE}` to the `WORKFLOW` string and then executes the assembled command using `eval`. This allows for dynamic workflow execution based on the value of `WORKFLOWMODE`.
