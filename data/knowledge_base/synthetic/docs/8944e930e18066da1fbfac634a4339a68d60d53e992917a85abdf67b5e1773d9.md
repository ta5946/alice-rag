## Content

ALICE3-related simulation discussions are addressed through a specific [meeting category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12828/) as well.

## JIRA Bug Tracking

Issues or feature requests should be managed using tickets in our [JIRA system](https://alice.its.cern.ch/jira/projects/O2) (with the simulation component selected). It's recommended to open these tickets rather than using private email.

This list offers an overview of additional resources and platforms for exchanging information related to simulation topics:


## Communication

The following channels are utilized for discussions on simulation topics:

* [Mattermost O2DPG channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2dpg) - for conversations on the O2DPG MC production system

* [Mattermost Run3 Simulation channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-simulation) - for addressing questions about ALICE simulation in general

* [ALICE Talk](https://alice-talk.web.cern.ch/) - a Discourse-style discussion forum


## Meetings

Detector simulation meetings are conducted as "WP12 / WP13 meetings" within this [indico category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/4868/). Announcements are distributed through the `alice-o2-wp12` CERN E-group. These meetings usually occur on Wednesdays at 3pm, every 2 or 3 weeks.
