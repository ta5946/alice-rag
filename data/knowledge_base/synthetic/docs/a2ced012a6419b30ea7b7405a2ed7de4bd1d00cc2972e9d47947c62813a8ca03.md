## Content

This is a straightforward simulation example demonstrating

a) how to execute a basic background event simulation with specific parameter adjustments
b) how to conduct a simulation that generates signal events using a custom external generator capable of altering its behavior based on the characteristics of the background event.

Pythia8 events are produced according to the settings defined in the `adaptive_pythia8.macro` file. These settings ensure that Pythia8 starts with the `pythia8_inel.cfg` configuration. Customization is provided so that the generator can receive and respond to a notification indicating the embedding status of the simulation, allowing it to determine subsequent actions based on the background event header. Specifically, the number of Pythia8 events to be embedded is determined by a formula involving the count of primary particles in the background events.

The macro file is defined using the `--configKeyValues` option with the key `GeneratorExternal.fileName`, and the function call to fetch the configuration and set the formula is specified through `GeneratorExternal.funcName`.
