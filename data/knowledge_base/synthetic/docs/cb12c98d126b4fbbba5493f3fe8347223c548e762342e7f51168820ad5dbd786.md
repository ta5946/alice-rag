This manual provides instructions on utilizing the Hybrid generator with the o2-sim. All other generators are implemented as sub-generators and can be invoked through a JSON file, which is passed to o2-sim via the GeneratorHybrid.configFile parameter. To make use of this example, the O2sim package must be loaded.

The runo2sim.sh script can be used to automatically execute the example, which includes a majority of the available generators in O2. A JSON template can be created using the ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_hybrid_gen.py script. For this example, users can simply copy the entire Hybrid example folder and run the script after granting it executable permissions (`chmod +x runo2sim.sh`).
