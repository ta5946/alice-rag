\page refrunSimExamplesPythiaHepMCWrapper Example illustrating the simple extraction of HepMC data using GeneratorPythia8

/doxy -->

This example shows how to enhance GeneratorPythia8 with a user-defined macro (or an external generator) to enable additional HepMC3 output of generated Pythia8 events.

It includes a handy tool for those who need to convert Pythia8 events into HepMC files. Note that other methods to achieve this are available (refer to the original Pythia8 example).

The example includes:

- The external generator implementation `Pythia8HepMC3.C`
- A `run.sh` script to demonstrate its usage, along with a check by feeding the generated HepMC data back into the simulation.
