In order for AliRoot to be loaded after O2, use the following command sequence:
`alienv enter O2/latest,AliRoot/latest`
Loading AliRoot before O2 might result in unresolved symbol issues.

# WARNING
The simulation's physics output has not been fully tested and validated.

This complex simulation example illustrates the process of running event generation with the AMPT event generator interface from AliRoot. A wrapper class named AliRoot_AMPT is created to manage the AliGenAmpt instance and set its configurations. Additionally, it offers methods to predefine the random event plane and to update the event header.

The overall setup is controlled by the `ampt` function, which is defined in the macro `aliroot_ampt.macro`. The macro file is referenced through the `--configKeyValues` option by setting `GeneratorExternal.fileName`, and the specific function call to retrieve the configuration is set via `GeneratorExternal.funcName`.

# IMPORTANT
To execute this example, you must load an AliRoot package that is compatible with O2. For further information, see https://alice.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/AOGM-246.
