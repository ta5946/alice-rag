## Content

The macro file can be set using the `--configKeyValues` parameter `GeneratorExternal.funcName`, and the function call to fetch the configuration and define the formula is indicated by `GeneratorExternal.funcName`.

The event generator used for background embedding must supply an impact parameter; Pythia8 heavy-ion model fulfills this requirement by providing this value.

This document illustrates the following:

a) How to execute a basic background event simulation with certain parameter adjustments.
b) How to configure and operate an event generator that produces signal events, based on the impact parameter of the background event into which it will be embedded.

Custom signal events are generated according to settings outlined in a file named 'signal_impactb.macro'. The custom event generator responds to a notification indicating the embedding status of the simulation, using the background event's header to guide its actions. Here, the impact parameter of the background event determines the number of signal particles to be generated.
