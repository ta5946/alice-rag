These examples illustrate how to perform on-the-fly event generation for DPL (analysis) tasks.

List of examples:
- run.sh --> inject events from an existing kinematics file
- run_Pythia8.sh --> generate Pythia8 events within the DPL device and forward them to the analysis
- run_trigger.sh --> generate Pythia8 events with triggering in the DPL device and forward them to the analysis
- run_O2Kine.sh --> generate events and save them in a kinematics file; read back these events and publish them to the analysis task
