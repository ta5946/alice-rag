This manual illustrates the use of the Hybrid generator within o2-sim. Other generators are integrated as sub-generators and can be invoked through a JSON file, which is passed to o2-sim via the GeneratorHybrid.configFile parameter. To utilize this example, the O2sim package must be loaded.

The runo2sim.sh script can be used to automatically execute this example, incorporating the majority of the available generators in O2. The JSON template can be created with the ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_hybrid_gen.py script. For simplicity, users can copy the entire Hybrid example folder and then run the script by granting it execution permissions (`chmod +x runo2sim.sh`).
