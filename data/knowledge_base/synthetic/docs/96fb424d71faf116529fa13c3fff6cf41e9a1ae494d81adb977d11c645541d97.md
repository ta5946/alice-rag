## Content

This is a straightforward simulation example demonstrating the process of running event simulation with the Pythia8 event generator in heavy-ion mode, along with the implementation of an external custom trigger.
This external trigger utilizes the `DeepTrigger` feature, enabling users to access the internal workings of the event generator to tailor the trigger logic.
In this example, the trigger selection utilizes the impact parameter of the currently generated Pythia8 heavy-ion event.
The criteria for accepting the impact parameters are set within a min-max range, which can be adjusted via command-line arguments.

The configuration and setup of the external `DeepTrigger` are handled by the function `trigger_impactb_pythia8(double bMin = 0., double bMax = 20.)`, which is defined in the macro `trigger_impactb_pythia8.macro`.

---

The macro file and function names are defined using the `--configKeyValues` options `TriggerExternal.fileName` and `TriggerExternal.funcName`, respectively.

# WARNING
Utilizing a trigger is not always the most efficient approach for event generation.
It is generally recommended to find a method to bias the event generation process to save CPU time.
In certain cases, selecting a particular impact-parameter range in Pythia8 can result in significant time spent during event generation rather than in the simulation.
