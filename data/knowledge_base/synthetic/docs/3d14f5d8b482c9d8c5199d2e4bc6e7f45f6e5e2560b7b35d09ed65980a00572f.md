## Content

# A straightforward example illustrating how to configure o2-sim to bypass the transport/physics steps and save only the events generated initially.
# Although this can be accomplished in various ways, the example serves to clarify the configuration process.
# Essentially, the configuration involves disabling physics in the file and applying strict geometry cuts to prevent Geant from performing any calculations.

# first step --> generate events using Pythia8 (no transport)
o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -m CAVE --configFile only_primarykine.ini

# second step --> read back events from O2 kine (no transport)
o2-sim -n 10 -g extkinO2 --extKinFile o2sim_Kine.root -m CAVE --configFile only_primarykine.ini -o o2sim2

# ideally, the kinematics files from both stages should match.
