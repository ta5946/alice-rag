# Simulation examples

## Execute a simulation workflow

The script [O2DPG_pp_minbias.sh](O2DPG_pp_minbias.sh) includes four stages:
1. constructing the simulation workflow,
1. running the workflow through the AOD stage,
1. performing QC checks (optional, if desired),
1. conducting test analyses (optional, if desired).

To run the script (including QC checks and test analyses), use the command:
```bash
DOQC=1 DOANALYSIS=1 ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/run/examples/O2DPG_pp_minbias.sh
```

You can also adjust the memory and CPU usage settings. For example, you can add:
* `MEMLIMIT=12000` to set the memory limit to 12,000 MB,
* `CPULIMIT=8` to specify the number of CPUs to use as 8,
to the execution command.
