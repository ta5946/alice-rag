# An example of generating DPL Pythia8 events without vertex smearing and subsequently injecting them into the analysis framework

set -x

NEVENTS=1000

# --aggregate-timeframe 10 combines 10 generated events into a single timeframe, which is then converted into AOD tables.
# It's important to note that if specific configurations are needed for the analysis tasks, these should also be included in the proxy and converter.
