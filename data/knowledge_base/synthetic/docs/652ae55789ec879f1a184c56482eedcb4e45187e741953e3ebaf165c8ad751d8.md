\page refrunSimExamplesSelective_Transport_pi0 Example of Selective Particle Transport
/doxy -->

This simulation example demonstrates running the simulation and selectively transporting particles
through the detector geometry based on configurable settings, as well as utilizing the external event trigger
mechanism on generators.

The simulation employs the Pythia8 pp generator with default settings.
The specific simulation parameters are configured in the sim.ini file.

Only the settings for selective particle transport are modified, including:
```
[Stack]
transportPrimary=external
transportPrimaryFileName=transportPDG.macro
transportPrimaryFuncName=transportPDG(321)
transportPrimaryInvert=false
```

---

`transportPrimary` specifies the selection method, with `external` indicating that the definition is loaded via a plugin macro, accessed through `transportPrimaryFuncName` in the file `transportPrimaryFileName`. `transportPrimaryInvert` enables the inversion of the selection, thus preventing transport for the chosen particles.

The second phase of these simulation examples illustrates how to proceed from the initial step by propagating all remaining tracks. This is executed only for events that meet a specific trigger condition, requiring both photons from the pi0 decay to have converted within a designated region.
