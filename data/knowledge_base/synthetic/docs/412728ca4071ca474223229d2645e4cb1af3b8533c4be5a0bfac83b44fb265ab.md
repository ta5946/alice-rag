## Retrieving PRs (based on labels)

The script `o2dpg_make_github_pr_report.py` can generate a markdown report of PRs in a specified repository. PRs are retrieved and listed according to their assigned labels. By default, the script searches for labels formatted as `async-*`. PRs are initially sorted by their stateâ€”closed and merged, just closed, and open. Within each state, they are grouped by labels and further sorted by time. The time-based sorting criteria are as follows:

- For `state closed` and `merged`, the `merged_at` timestamp is used.
- For `state closed` but not `merged`, the `updated_at` timestamp is used.
- For `state open`, the `updated_at` timestamp is used.

To retrieve PRs for `O2`, execute the following command, which will produce a markdown report saved as `o2dpg_pr_report_O2DPG.md`:
```bash
./UTILS/o2dpg_make_github_pr_report.py --repo O2DPG
```
