## Content

**Question:** What is the main purpose of the TPC calibration documentation as described in the document?

**Answer:** The main purpose of the TPC calibration documentation is to serve as an index or guide for various calibration procedures related to the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) in particle physics experiments, specifically those conducted with the ALICE O2 collaboration. It provides links to detailed subpages that cover different aspects of TPC calibration, including calibration of dEdx, IDC (integrated drift chamber) calibration, calibration of pad gain using tracks, and average distortion correction.
