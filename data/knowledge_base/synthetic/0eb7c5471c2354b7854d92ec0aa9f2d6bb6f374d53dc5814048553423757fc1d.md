**Question:** What is the purpose of the `CTF_DICT` variable in the o2-ctf-writer-workflow command, and where is the dictionary file specified?

**Answer:** The `CTF_DICT` variable in the o2-ctf-writer-workflow command is used to specify the CTF dictionary file, which contains the necessary information for the workflow to interpret and process the CTF data correctly. The CTF dictionary file is specified as `--ctf-dict $FILEWORKDIR/ctf_dictionary.root`, indicating that it is located in the `ctf_dictionary.root` file within the `FILEWORKDIR` directory.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--disable-root-output` option in the o2-tof-reco-workflow command?

**Answer:** The `--disable-root-output` option in the o2-tof-reco-workflow command is used to prevent the generation of ROOT output files. This can be useful to reduce disk I/O and storage requirements, or to avoid handling large amounts of data in ROOT format, especially when the downstream processing does not require or can efficiently handle ROOT files.
