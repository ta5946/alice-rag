**Question:** What is the default path from which the `get_config` function reads the `analyses_config.json` file?

**Answer:** The default path from which the `get_config` function reads the `analyses_config.json` file is `join(O2DPG_ROOT, "MC", "config", "analysis_testing", "json", "analyses_config.json")`.

---

**Question:** What is the default path used by the `get_config` function to locate the `analyses_config.json` file?

**Answer:** The default path used by the `get_config` function to locate the `analyses_config.json` file is `join(O2DPG_ROOT, "MC", "config", "analysis_testing", "json", "analyses_config.json")`.

---

**Question:** What specific actions would be taken if the custom path provided by the user does not contain an `analyses_config.json` file, and the user has specified a directory as the path?

**Answer:** If the custom path provided by the user does not contain an `analyses_config.json` file and the user has specified a directory as the path, the following actions would be taken:

1. The script would first check if the specified path is indeed a directory using `isdir(path)`.
2. It would then assume that the `analyses_config.json` file is located inside this directory and modify the path to include it, setting `path` to `join(path, "analyses_config.json")`.
3. If the modified path does not exist (checked with `exists(path)`), a warning message would be printed indicating that the config file could not be found at the custom path and suggesting to use the default configuration at `join(O2DPG_ROOT, "MC", "config", "analysis_testing", "json", "analyses_config.json")`.
4. The script would then use the default configuration path by setting `path` to `default_path`.

**Question:** What will be printed to stdout if the task is enabled?

**Answer:** ENABLED

---

**Question:** What does the `check` function print when the `--status` option is provided, and how does it determine the status of the analysis tasks?

**Answer:** When the `--status` option is provided to the `check` function, it prints "ENABLED" or "DISABLED" based on the status of the analysis tasks. The function determines this status by examining the `enabled` field of each task in the `analyses` list, which is loaded from the configuration file specified by `args.config`. If `enabled` is `True`, it prints "ENABLED"; otherwise, it prints "DISABLED".

---

**Question:** What specific conditions must be met for an analysis task to be marked as "ENABLED" in the configuration, and how does the `check` function determine the status of an analysis task?

**Answer:** For an analysis task to be marked as "ENABLED" in the configuration, it must meet one of two conditions:
1. The task is specified in the `args.enable_tasks` list provided as a command-line argument.
2. The task is not specified in the `args.disable_tasks` list, and `args.disable_tasks` is provided as a command-line argument.

The `check` function determines the status of an analysis task by:
1. Retrieving the configuration using `get_config(args.config)`.
2. Calling the `print_status` function with the value of `ana["enabled"]` for each task.
3. If `ana["enabled"]` is `True`, it prints "ENABLED".
4. If `ana["enabled"]` is `False`, it prints "DISABLED".

---

**Question:** What happens if neither --enabled nor --disabled flags are provided when calling the `show_tasks` function?

**Answer:** If neither --enabled nor --disabled flags are provided when calling the `show_tasks` function, the function sets both `args.enabled` and `args.disabled` to `True`. As a result, all analyses will be printed regardless of their enabled or disabled status.

---

**Question:** What specific actions are taken if the specified analysis task is not found in the configurations?

**Answer:** If the specified analysis task is not found in the configurations, the document indicates that a warning message "WARNING: Unknown task [task_name]" is printed, where [task_name] is the name provided in the arguments. Then, the function returns 1 to signify an error.

---

**Question:** What specific checks are performed in the `validate_output` function to ensure the validity of the analysis tasks, and how do these checks differ from those in the `show_tasks` function?

**Answer:** The `validate_output` function does not specify any particular checks to ensure the validity of the analysis tasks. It is designed to perform actions based on command-line arguments rather than validate the tasks. Specifically, it processes command-line arguments `args.status` and `args.applicable_to` to print status or applicable information about the tasks.

In contrast, the `show_tasks` function performs checks based on `args.enabled` and `args.disabled` to filter and print tasks based on their enabled or disabled state. 

Therefore, the `validate_output` function does not include detailed validation logic and instead relies on external actions or conditions to ensure task validity, whereas the `show_tasks` function filters and prints tasks based on their enabled or disabled states.

---

**Question:** What is the initial value of the `ret` variable in the `validate_output` function?

**Answer:** The initial value of the `ret` variable in the `validate_output` function is 0.

---

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `include_disabled` variable and how does it get updated in the function?

**Answer:** The `include_disabled` variable is used to determine whether or not to check analyses that are by default disabled. It is initially set based on the `args.include_disabled` parameter. This variable gets updated within the function if `args.tasks` are specified. If `args.tasks` are provided and `analysis_name` (the name of the current analysis) is found within `args.tasks`, `include_disabled` is set to `True`, ensuring that even disabled analyses are checked.

---

**Question:** What is the initial value of the `ret` variable and how does it change if an analysis with a disabled status is included in the tasks specified by the user?

**Answer:** The initial value of the `ret` variable is 0. If an analysis with a disabled status is included in the tasks specified by the user, the `include_disabled` variable is set to True. However, this change in `include_disabled` does not directly affect the value of `ret`, which remains 0 unless altered elsewhere in the code.

---

**Question:** What action is taken if the expected output directory for an analysis does not exist?

**Answer:** If the expected output directory for an analysis does not exist, a message is printed indicating the absence of the directory, the return value `ret` is set to 1, and the process continues with the next iteration.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the expected output directory for an analysis does not exist?

**Answer:** If the expected output directory for an analysis does not exist, the script prints a message indicating that the directory does not exist and sets the return value `ret` to 1 before continuing with the next iteration.

---

**Question:** What specific actions are taken if the expected output directory does not exist or the expected outputs are missing for a given analysis, and how does the script handle disabled analyses?

**Answer:** If the expected output directory does not exist for a given analysis, the script prints a message indicating that the directory is missing and sets the return value to 1, then continues to the next iteration. If the analysis is disabled and the user is not including disabled analyses, the script simply skips to the next iteration without further action. For each expected output specified in the analysis configuration, the script checks if the file exists within the analysis directory. If any expected output is missing, the script prints a message detailing the missing file and also sets the return value to 1. If an analysis is disabled but the user is including disabled analyses, the script proceeds with the checks for expected outputs.

---

**Question:** What action is taken if the exit code found in the log file is not "0"?

**Answer:** If the exit code found in the log file is not "0", the script prints a message indicating that the Analysis had a non-zero exit code, sets `ret` to 1, and breaks out of the loop.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken if the exit code from the log file is non-zero for the analysis named "analysis_name"?

**Answer:** If the exit code from the log file is non-zero for the analysis named "analysis_name", the following actions are taken:
- The message "Analysis analysis_name had non-zero exit code [exit_code]." is printed.
- The variable `ret` is set to 1.
- The loop is exited using the `break` statement.

---

**Question:** What specific actions are taken if the exit code from the log file is non-zero and the log_done file is missing for a given analysis?

**Answer:** If the exit code from the log file is non-zero and the log_done file is missing for a given analysis, the following actions are taken:

1. A message is printed: "Apparently, analysis {analysis_name} did not run successfully, {logfile_done} does not exist."
2. The variable `ret` is set to 1, indicating an error.

---

**Question:** What does the `main` function do in this script?

**Answer:** The `main` function serves as the entry point for the script when it is run directly from the command line. It sets up an argument parser to handle command-line arguments for checking, validating, or modifying analysis configurations. Specifically, it defines sub-commands for each operation and their respective arguments. When the "modify" command is selected, it calls the `modify` function with the specified arguments.

---

**Question:** What actions are taken when the "modify" command is executed and what arguments are required for this action?

**Answer:** When the "modify" command is executed, the following actions are taken:

- An input configuration can be specified using the `--config` or `-c` argument.
- An output file name for the new configuration can be provided using the `--output` or `-o` argument. If not provided, the default output file name is `analyses_config.json`.
- Analysis task names to enable can be specified using the `--enable-tasks` argument, which accepts multiple task names.
- Analysis task names to disable can be specified using the `--disable-tasks` argument, which also accepts multiple task names and takes precedence over `--enable-tasks`.

These arguments allow users to modify the analysis configuration by enabling or disabling specific tasks as needed.

---

**Question:** What happens if both --enable-tasks and --disable-tasks are specified for the modify command, and how does the script handle this situation?

**Answer:** If both --enable-tasks and --disable-tasks are specified for the modify command, the script will prioritize the tasks specified by --disable-tasks, meaning those tasks will be disabled regardless of whether they were originally enabled or disabled. Tasks specified by --enable-tasks will only be enabled if they were previously disabled.

---

**Question:** What does the `--enabled` argument do in the `show-tasks` command?

**Answer:** The `--enabled` argument in the `show-tasks` command is used to show the enabled tasks.

---

**Question:** What does the `--applicable-to` flag do when used with the `check` command?

**Answer:** The `--applicable-to` flag, when used with the `check` command, checks whether the specified analysis task is valid for Monte Carlo (MC) or data.

---

**Question:** What specific actions does the `--status` flag perform when used with the `check` command, and how does it interact with the `--task` argument?

**Answer:** The `--status` flag, when used with the `check` command, specifically checks if the specified task is enabled or disabled. It interacts with the `--task` argument by evaluating the status of the named analysis task provided.

---

**Question:** What argument is required when using the "validate-output" task?

**Answer:** The "--directory" argument is required when using the "validate-output" task.

---

**Question:** What is the default behavior of the `validate-output` task if no specific analysis tasks are provided via the `--tasks` argument?

**Answer:** If no specific analysis tasks are provided via the `--tasks` argument, all analyses are validated by default.

---

**Question:** What specific conditions must be met for a task to be included in the validation process when the "--include-disabled" flag is not used?

**Answer:** When the "--include-disabled" flag is not used, a task must be specified explicitly with the --tasks flag in order to be included in the validation process.
