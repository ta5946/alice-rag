**Question:** What specific condition causes the script to terminate with an exit code of 1 after sourcing the calibration workflow script, and how does the script handle this condition?

**Answer:** The script terminates with an exit code of 1 after sourcing the calibration workflow script if the sourcing operation fails.

If the exit status is non-zero (indicating failure), the script prints an error message "calib-workflow.sh failed" to standard error and exits with a status of 1.
