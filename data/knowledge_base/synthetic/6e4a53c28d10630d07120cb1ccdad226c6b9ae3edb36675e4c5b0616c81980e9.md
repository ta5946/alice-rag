## Content

**Question:** What is the purpose of this repository?

**Answer:** The purpose of this repository is to collect scripts and configurations for running Monte Carlo simulations and data reconstruction of the ALICE experiment within the O2 project.

**Question:** What changes were made to the repository structure to accommodate the transition from the O2DataProcessing repository to this one?

**Answer:** The repository structure was modified to integrate the content from the former O2DataProcessing repository into a new location. Specifically, the scripts and configurations from O2DataProcessing were moved to a new directory named [DATA](DATA). This change was made to better organize the simulation and data reconstruction scripts for the ALICE experiment within the O2 project. Additionally, documentation for Monte Carlo simulations and data reconstruction was placed in separate directories, [MC/README.md](MC/README.md) and [DATA/README.md](DATA/README.md), to provide clearer guidance on how to use the various resources available in the repository.

**Question:** What specific changes or migrations were made to adapt the content of the former O2DataProcessing repository to the current structure, and how do these changes impact the workflow for Monte Carlo simulations and data reconstruction in the O2 project?

**Answer:** The content from the former O2DataProcessing repository was migrated to the [DATA](DATA) directory in the current O2DPG repository. This change impacts the workflow for Monte Carlo simulations and data reconstruction in the O2 project by requiring users to now access the necessary scripts and configurations from the updated directory structure. Instead of directly using the O2DataProcessing repository, users must refer to the [MC/README.md](MC/README.md) and [DATA/README.md](DATA/README.md) files for detailed instructions on how to proceed with simulations and data processing. This reorganization ensures that all relevant simulation and reconstruction tasks are consolidated within the O2DPG project, enhancing organization and potentially streamlining the workflow.
