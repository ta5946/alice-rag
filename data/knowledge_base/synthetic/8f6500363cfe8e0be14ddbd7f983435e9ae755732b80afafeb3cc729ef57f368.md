**Question:** What command-line options are used to configure the diamond detector width in the simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The diamond detector width is configured using the following command-line option:

`-confKey "Diamond.width[0]=0.005;Diamond.width[1]=0.005;Diamond.width[2]=6."`

This sets the width of the diamond detector in three dimensions to 0.005 in the first two dimensions and 6 in the third dimension.
