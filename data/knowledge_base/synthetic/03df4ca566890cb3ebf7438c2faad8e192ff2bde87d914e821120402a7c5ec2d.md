**Question:** What are the command-line options used for embedding in the workflow, and how are the background and signal processes specified for PbPb and pp collisions?

**Answer:** The command-line options for embedding in the workflow are specified with the `-eCM ${CONFIG_ENERGY}` and `-embedding` flags. For the background and signal processes in PbPb collisions, the following options are used:

- `-colBkg PbPb` specifies the collision type for background.
- `-genBkg pythia8` sets the generator for background to pythia8.
- `-procBkg "heavy_ion"` defines the processing method for background as "heavy_ion".

For pp collisions, the signal processes are specified as:

- `-col pp` sets the collision type to pp.
- `-gen pythia8` uses pythia8 as the generator.
- `-proc "jets"` processes the events as jets.

**Question:** What is the default value of the `PTHATBIN` variable if it is not set before running the script?

**Answer:** The default value of the `PTHATBIN` variable if it is not set before running the script is 1.

**Question:** What will be the values of PTHATMIN and PTHATMAX if PTHATBIN is set to 3 and the arrays pthatbin_loweredges and pthatbin_higheredges contain the values [100, 200, 300, 400] respectively?

**Answer:** PTHATMIN will be 300 and PTHATMAX will be 400.
