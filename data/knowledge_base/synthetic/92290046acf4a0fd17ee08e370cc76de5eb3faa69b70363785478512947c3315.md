**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--aggregate-timeframe` option in the `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` command?

**Answer:** The `--aggregate-timeframe` option in the `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` command is used to specify the aggregation of event time frames. By setting it to a value of 10, events are combined into time frames of 10 events each. This can be useful for reducing the overhead of individual event processing and potentially improving simulation performance by processing events in batches.
