**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed "s/| */|\n/g"` command in the given script?

**Answer:** The `sed "s/| */|\n/g"` command in the script is used to transform the workflow command string. Specifically, it replaces instances of one or more spaces following a pipe symbol (|) with a newline character (\n). This transformation effectively converts a single line with pipeline-separated commands into multiple lines, making the commands more readable when printed.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `PROXY_OUTSPEC` variable in the workflow and what type of data does it specify?

**Answer:** The `PROXY_OUTSPEC` variable in the workflow specifies the type of data to be output by the processing pipeline. It is set to "calib:FT0/TIME_SPECTRA/0", indicating that the output data consists of calibration information specifically pertaining to time spectra from the Forward Tracker (FT0) subsystem. This data is intended for further analysis or processing steps following the calibration stage.
