**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` command in the script and how does it transform the `WORKFLOW` variable?

**Answer:** The `sed` command in the script is used to transform the `WORKFLOW` variable by converting instances of `| ` (pipe followed by a space) into newlines (`\n`). This effectively splits the string into multiple lines, making it easier to view or process each part of the workflow command separately. When the `WORKFLOWMODE` is set to "print", the script uses `sed` to format the `WORKFLOW` content, presenting each part of the workflow command on a new line.
