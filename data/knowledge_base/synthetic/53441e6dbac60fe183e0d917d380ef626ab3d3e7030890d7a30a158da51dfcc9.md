**Question:** What specific command-line arguments are used to configure the interaction rate and the number of time frames in the simulation workflow, and how are they specified in the script?

**Answer:** The interaction rate and the number of time frames in the simulation workflow are configured using the `-confKeyBkg` and `-tf` command-line arguments, respectively. The `-confKeyBkg` argument is set to "Diamond.width[2]=6" to configure the background diamond detector width, while the `-tf` argument is set to the value specified by the `NTIMEFRAMES` variable, which defaults to 1 if not defined.
