**Question:** What are the specific data specifications and injection methods used in the o2-dpl-raw-proxy workflow that are not mentioned in the subsequent data processing pipelines?

**Answer:** The o2-dpl-raw-proxy workflow uses specific data specifications defined by "${PROXY_INSPEC}" and an injection method with "--inject-missing-data" that are not mentioned in the subsequent data processing pipelines like o2-fdd-entropy-encoder-workflow, o2-ft0-entropy-encoder-workflow, and o2-fv0-entropy-encoder-workflow.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `ARGS_CTF` variable in the given script and what specific parameters does it configure for the CTF (Compact Trigger File) processing?

**Answer:** The `ARGS_CTF` variable in the provided script is designed to configure parameters for CTF (Compact Trigger File) processing. Specifically, it sets the minimum file size to 500 MB with `--min-file-size 500000000`, limits the maximum number of CTFs per file to 10,000 with `--max-ctf-per-file 10000`, and specifies the output directory for metadata as `/data/epn2eos_tool/epn2eos` using `--meta-output-dir /data/epn2eos_tool/epn2eos`. Additionally, it ensures that detector information is appended to the period with `--append-det-to-period 0`.
