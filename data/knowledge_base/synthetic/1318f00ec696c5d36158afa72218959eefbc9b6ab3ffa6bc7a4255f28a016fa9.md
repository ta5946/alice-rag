**Question:** What are the steps taken in the injection block to ensure the script is executed inside an Apptainer container if it's not already running within one?

**Answer:** The injection block first checks if the script is running inside an Apptainer (or Singularity) container by verifying the presence of the environment variables APPTAINER_NAME or SINGULARITY_NAME. If these variables are not set, indicating the script is not inside a container, the following steps are taken to ensure the script runs inside a container:

1. A temporary directory is created at /tmp/foo-${ALIEN_PID} if it does not already exist.
2. The temporary directory is populated with a token certificate, copied from /tmp/token*pem.
3. The original script is copied into this temporary directory.
4. The script detects the hardware architecture using the uname -i command. If the architecture is either aarch64 or x86_64, a flag ISAARCH64 is set to 1. If the architecture is invalid, the script exits with an error message.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `sed` commands in the document, and how do they modify the script?

**Answer:** The `sed` commands in the document are used to remove certain lines from the script and to replace the placeholder with the actual Alien Job Process ID. Specifically:

1. The first `sed` command removes the lines that mention creating a fresh sandbox at every job attempt, along with the commands to remove the previous sandbox and create a new one.

2. The second `sed` command removes the line that creates a new directory for the sandbox.

3. The third `sed` command removes the line that changes directory to the sandbox location.

4. The fourth `sed` command replaces the placeholder `#ALIEN_PID#` with the actual value of the `ALIEN_PID` environment variable throughout the script.

These modifications effectively strip out the sandboxing structure and replace the placeholder with the current job's process ID, ensuring that the script operates correctly in a non-sandboxed environment.

**Question:** What happens if neither the environment variable JALIEN_TOKEN_CERT nor the certificate files in the temporary directory are set?

**Answer:** If neither the environment variable JALIEN_TOKEN_CERT nor the certificate files in the temporary directory are set, the script will output the message "This needs a tokencert and tokenkey file in the tmp folder" and exit with a status code of 1.
