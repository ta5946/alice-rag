**Question:** What is the default number of signal events if not specified when running the simulation?

**Answer:** The default number of signal events is 1 if not specified when running the simulation.

**Question:** What specific parameters are used for the simulation workflow in terms of event generation, number of workers, time frames, and interaction rate, and how are they incorporated into the command line arguments for the simulation script?

**Answer:** The simulation workflow uses the following specific parameters for event generation, number of workers, time frames, and interaction rate, which are incorporated into the command line arguments for the simulation script:

- Event generation: External generation is specified with the `-gen external` flag.
- Center of mass energy: 13.6 TeV is set using the `-eCM 13600` flag.
- Number of signal events: 1 event is generated with the `-ns ${NSIGEVENTS}` flag, where `${NSIGEVENTS}` defaults to 1.
- Number of workers: 8 workers are specified with the `-j ${NWORKERS}` flag, where `${NWORKERS}` defaults to 8.
- Time frames: 1 time frame is set with the `-tf ${NTIMEFRAMES}` flag, where `${NTIMEFRAMES}` defaults to 1.
- Interaction rate: 500,000 interactions per second are specified with the `-interactionRate 500000` flag.

These parameters are integrated into the command line as follows:

```bash
${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM 13600 -gen external -j ${NWORKERS} -ns ${NSIGEVENTS} -tf ${NTIMEFRAMES} -e TGeant4 -mod "--skipModules ZDC" \
        -ini $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/config/PWGDQ/ini/Generator_InjectedPromptJpsiFwdy_TriggerGap.ini --mft-assessment-full --fwdmatching-assessment-full -interactionRate 500000 
```

This command sets up the simulation workflow with the specified parameters, including the use of the TGeant4 event generator and additional modules to skip ZDC, as well as specific configurations for MFT and Fwd matching assessments.
