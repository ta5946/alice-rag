**Question:** What are the key components involved in performing a generator-only analysis using O2Physics as described in this simulation example?

**Answer:** The key components involved in performing a generator-only analysis using O2Physics as described in this simulation example are:

1. STARLIGHT event generator: Used to produce HepMC files.
2. `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` tool: Invoked to generate events based on the HepMC files from STARLIGHT.
3. `o2-sim-mctracks-to-aod` tool: Converts Monte Carlo tracks to AOD format.
4. `o2-analysis-mctracks-to-aod-simple-task` tool: Performs simple analysis on the AOD data.

These components work together to set up and run the generator-only analysis, with the STARLIGHT generator providing the event input and the O2Physics tools handling the simulation and analysis processes.
