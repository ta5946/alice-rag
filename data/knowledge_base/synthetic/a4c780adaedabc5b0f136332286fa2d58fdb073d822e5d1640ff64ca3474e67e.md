**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--aggregate-timeframe` option in the `o2-sim-mctracks-proxy` command?

**Answer:** The `--aggregate-timeframe` option in the `o2-sim-mctracks-proxy` command is used to specify the duration of timeframes that will be aggregated by the consumer. This aggregation helps in reducing the overhead associated with frequent updates and allows for more efficient data processing, especially when dealing with a large number of events.
