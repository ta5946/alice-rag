**Question:** How many events are simulated in this script?

**Answer:** 100

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `--aggregate-timeframe` option in the `o2-sim-mctracks-proxy` command?

**Answer:** The `--aggregate-timeframe` option in the `o2-sim-mctracks-proxy` command is used to specify the duration of timeframes that will be aggregated by the consumer. This aggregation helps in reducing the overhead associated with frequent updates and allows for more efficient data processing, especially when dealing with a large number of events.

**Question:** What is the significance of the `--aggregate-timeframe 1` option in the o2-sim-mctracks-proxy command, and how does it interact with the `--timeframes-rate-limit` option?

**Answer:** The `--aggregate-timeframe 1` option in the o2-sim-mctracks-proxy command specifies that timeframes should be aggregated every 1 second. This means that the output data will be grouped into 1-second intervals, facilitating the handling and analysis of events within this time window.

The `--timeframes-rate-limit` option, in this case set to 1, determines the maximum number of timeframes that can be processed per second. By setting it to 1, it ensures that no more than one timeframe is processed every second, which aligns with the aggregation interval specified by `--aggregate-timeframe 1`.

Together, these options control the rate at which data is processed and grouped, ensuring that the system does not overwhelm itself with too much data too quickly, while also maintaining a structured format for the time-ordered events.
