**Question:** What are the different types of input specifications for the MID raw data proxy, and how are they defined in the document?

**Answer:** The different types of input specifications for the MID raw data proxy, as defined in the document, are:

1. `MID_PROXY_INSPEC_DD`: This is defined as `dd:FLP/DISTSUBTIMEFRAME/0`.

2. `MID_PROXY_INSPEC_EOS`: This is defined as `eos:***/INFORMATION`.

3. `MID_RAW_PROXY_INSPEC`: This combines the previous two specifications and is defined as `A:MID/RAWDATA;$MID_PROXY_INSPEC_DD;$MID_PROXY_INSPEC_EOS`.

**Question:** What specific options are used for the MID CTF writer and what are their purposes?

**Answer:** The specific options used for the MID CTF writer are:

--output-dir "$CTF_DIR" - Specifies the directory where the CTF (Compact Trigger File) files will be written. The $CTF_DIR is a variable that should be defined elsewhere in the script.

--onlyDet "MID" - Indicates that the MID (Midplane) detector data should be included in the CTF files.

--min-file-size 500000000 - Sets the minimum file size for the CTF files to 500 MB.

--max-ctf-per-file 10000 - Specifies that a maximum of 10,000 CTF events should be stored in each file before the file is closed and a new one is created.

--meta-output-dir "$EPN2EOS_METAFILES_DIR" - Determines the directory where the metadata for the CTF files will be stored. The $EPN2EOS_METAFILES_DIR variable should be defined elsewhere in the script.
