**Question:** What is the purpose of the `JQ_COMMAND` in the script and how does it modify the JSON file?

**Answer:** The `JQ_COMMAND` in the script is designed to append a new object to the JSON file, specifically adding an event count offset. It modifies the JSON file by executing a series of commands using `jq`, which is a command-line JSON processor. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it operates:

1. It initializes a new JSON file if it doesn't exist, or overwrites an existing one with an empty JSON array: `echo "[]" > ${JSON_FILE}`.

2. It uses `jq` to manipulate the JSON file:
    - The `+` operator in `jq` is used to merge two JSON objects.
    - It creates a new JSON object with a key `HepMCEventOffset` and assigns it the value of the `EVENTS` variable, which represents the event count offset.
    - The newly created object is then added to the JSON array in the file.

3. The command `jq '. + [{"HepMCEventOffset": ${EVENTS}}]' ${JSON_FILE} > tmp_123.json` performs the actual modification by merging the new object with the existing JSON content, and then outputs the result to a temporary file named `tmp_123.json`.

4. Finally, it renames the temporary file to the original JSON file name: `mv tmp_123.json ${JSON_FILE}`.

This process effectively appends a new event count offset to the JSON file, updating it with the specified number of events.
