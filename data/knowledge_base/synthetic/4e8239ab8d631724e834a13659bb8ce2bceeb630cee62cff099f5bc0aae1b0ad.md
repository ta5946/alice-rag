**Question:** What is the purpose of the `PROXY_INSPEC` variable in the workflow?

**Answer:** The `PROXY_INSPEC` variable in the workflow is used to specify the data selection and input specifications for the proxy. It defines the types of data to be proxied, including ITS (Inner Tracking System) cluster information, ITS pattern data, and ITS cluster ROF (Run Over Frame) data. The `PROXY_INSPEC` variable is crucial for directing the proxy to fetch only the necessary data streams, such as those marked with tags A, B, and C, and it also includes data from a specific EOS (Euler STORAGE) path. This configuration ensures that the workflow processes the correct data types and origins, optimizing the data handling and reducing unnecessary data transfer.
