**Question:** What is the specific database implementation used in the embedded template qc configuration for MC, and how does it differ from the other database-related settings provided in the configuration?

**Answer:** The specific database implementation used in the embedded template qc configuration for MC is "CCDB". This differs from the other database-related settings as follows:

- The "host" field is set to "ccdb-test.cern.ch:8080", indicating a specific server address.
- The "username", "password", and "name" fields are all set to "not_applicable", suggesting that authentication is not required or not specified for this database.
- The "conditionDB" section uses "alice-ccdb.cern.ch" as its "url", pointing to a different server than the "database" section.
- The "monitoring" and "consul" sections do not specify any database-related settings.

**Question:** What does the script do if the 'qc' section exists but the 'config' section does not in the JSON file?

**Answer:** If the 'qc' section exists but the 'config' section does not in the JSON file, the script will not modify anything related to 'config'. The script checks if both 'qc' and 'config' exist before updating the 'config' section. Therefore, in the absence of the 'config' section, no action is taken for it.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the `update_json_files` function in the given script?

**Answer:** The purpose of the `update_json_files` function is to read JSON files from a specified folder, update the 'config' section within the 'qc' part of each file using provided template data, and then write the updated content back to the respective JSON files.

**Question:** What is the purpose of updating the 'config' section in the 'qc' part of JSON files, and how does the script ensure that this update is applied to all relevant files in the specified folder?

**Answer:** The purpose of updating the 'config' section in the 'qc' part of JSON files is to synchronize the configuration settings with a template. This ensures consistency across multiple JSON files.

The script ensures that this update is applied to all relevant files in the specified folder by iterating through each JSON file in the provided directory. For each file, it checks if the 'qc' and 'config' sections exist. If they do, it updates the 'config' section with the new data from the template. The updated content is then written back to the file. This process is repeated for all files in the folder, ensuring that the 'config' section is updated in every relevant JSON file.
