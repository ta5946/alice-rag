**Question:** What is the relationship between the variables `RunningJobs` and `DoneJobs` in the given script, and why might they be the same?

**Answer:** The variables `RunningJobs` and `DoneJobs` in the given script are assigned the same value from the `tokens` array. Specifically, `RunningJobs` is assigned the value of `tokens[6]`, and `DoneJobs` is assigned the value of `tokens[5]`. They might be the same if the script or the data source intended to use the same value for both, possibly due to a configuration where the number of running jobs and done jobs is expected to be identical at a certain point or due to a bug or oversight in the script logic.
