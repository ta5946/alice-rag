**Question:** What is the default value for the number of signal events if not specified?

**Answer:** The default value for the number of signal events, if not specified, is 1.

**Question:** What specific command-line options and parameters are used to configure the background process in the simulation script, and how do they affect the simulation workflow?

**Answer:** The background process in the simulation script is configured using the following command-line options and parameters:

- `-genBkg pythia8`: Specifies the background generator as Pythia8.
- `-procBkg inel`: Processes the background as inelastic collisions.
- `--embedding`: Enables the embedding of background events into signal events.

These parameters affect the simulation workflow by determining the type of background events generated, how these events are processed, and whether they are mixed with signal events, which can influence the overall event rate and the types of events that are simulated.
