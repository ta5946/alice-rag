# Troubleshooting

## You are experiencing an issue

There is of course always the chance you might find the answer to your problem in this documentation. If not, please find [here](othreresources.md#contact) on how to get in touch with developers.
Please describe your problem in detail and provide a minimal reproducer (e.g. scripts, required input files) as well as any log files if available.

Depending on the complexity, you might be asked to open a ticket on [JIRA](otherresources.md#jira-bug-tracking) to track your issue. This enhances transparency and also other experts can easily join the discussion if needed.
On such a ticket, please make sure to provide the full picture and pointers to resources that are needed to reproduce the issue.
If it turns out that the problem is more complex/complicated, please also feel free to ask for a slot in the [WP12/13 meeting](otherresources.md#meetings) to explain and discuss within a broader round of experts.
