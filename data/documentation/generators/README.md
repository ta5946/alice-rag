# Generators

This section provides a documentation and the usage of primary generators in O2.

There are various [concert implementations](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/tree/dev/Generators/include/Generators) of generators in O2. Among others and often used there is [Pythia8](https://pythia.org). These predefined generators are invoked via
```bash
o2-sim -g <generator-name> [<potentialOtherArgs>]
```

Please find more specific information on configurations and testing of generators [here](generatorconfig.md).
