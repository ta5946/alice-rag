The usage of the Hybrid generator using cocktails is presented in this example.
The syntax of the JSON file shows how the cocktails can be grouped. Each generator will be pulled exactly once in order for each cocktail event generation.
The basic Hybrid Generator mechanisms are shown in the Hybrid and Hybrid_parallel example folders.
The cocktail configuration can not be setup with the template script for now.
