            "To access MC tracks given a MC label, you can use the `MCKinematicsReader` class. Specifically, you would initialize the `MCKinematicsReader` with the transport kinematics file and then use the `getTrack` method, providing the MC label as an argument. Here is an example of how you might do this:\n\n```cpp\n// init the reader from the transport kinematics file (assuming here prefix o2sim)\no2::steer::MCKinematicsReader reader(\"o2sim\", o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader::Mode::kMCKine);\n\n// Assuming you have an MC label stored in a variable `mcLabel`\nconst int mcLabel = 12345;\n\n// Access the MC track using the MC label\no2::MCTrack const* track = reader.getTrack(mcLabel);\nif (track) {\n    // Do something with the track\n} else {\n    // Handle the case where the track is not found\n}\n```\n\nFor more details on the `MCKinematicsReader` and other related methods, you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/simulation/include/SimulationDataFormat/MCKinematicsReader.h) and the provided documentation.",
            "To access MC tracks given a MC label, you can use the `o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader` class after digitization is done.
