Run the simulation workflow with the `--make-evtpool` option:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n     -eCM 14000 \\\n     -col pp \\\n     -gen pythia8 \\\n     -proc cdiff \\\n     -tf 2 \\\n     -ns 5000 \\\n     --make-evtpool \\\n     -seed 546 \\\n     -interactionRate 500000 \\\n     -productionTag \"evtpoolcreation\" \\\n     -o evtpool\n   ```\n   This command generates 5000 events across 2 timeframes using Pythia8, skips all transport steps, and merges the output into `evtpool.root`.\n\n2. Execute the workflow runner to run the job and produce the event pool:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f evtpool.json -tt pool\n   ```\n\n### Using an Event Pool:\nTo use the created event pool in a downstream simulation workflow:\n- Use `extkinO2` as the generator.\n- Specify the path to the `evtpool.root` file using the `GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName` configuration key.\n- Optionally enable phi angle randomization via `GeneratorFromO2Kine.randomphi=true`.\n\nExample command:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n  -eCM 14000 \\\n  -gen extkinO2 \\\n  -tf 2 \\\n  --ns 5000 \\\n  -confKey \"GeneratorFromO2Kine.randomphi=true;GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName=/path/to/evtpool.root\" \\\n  -interactionRate 500000\n```\nThen run the workflow:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod\n```\n\n> **Note**: By default, events from the pool are randomized with a fixed seed per timeframe, and phi randomization is not active unless explicitly enabled.\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [event_pool.sh example script](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/event_pool.sh)\n- [O2DPG Workflow README](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)",
            "To create and use event pools in the O2DPG simulation framework:\n\n1. **Create an event pool**:\n   - Use the `--make-evtpool` flag in the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script to generate a workflow that creates an event pool.\n   - Example command:\n     ```bash\n     ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen <generator> -eCM <emc energy [GeV]> -tf <nTFs> --ns <nEvents> --make-evtpool\n     ```\n   - This skips transport steps, sets the beam-spot vertex to `kNoVertex`, and ends with a `poolmerge` step that merges all `Kine.root` files from the timeframes into a single `evtpool.root` file.\n\n2. **Run the workflow to generate the event pool**:\n   - Execute the generated workflow using `o2dpg_workflow_runner.py` with the `-tt pool` option:\n     ```bash\n     ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt pool\n     ```\n\n3. **Use the event pool in a simulation workflow**:\n   - Set the generator to `extkinO2` and provide the path to the `evtpool.root` file:\n     ```bash\n     ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM <emc energy [GeV]> -gen extkinO2 -tf <nTFs> --ns <nEvents> \\\n       -confKey \"GeneratorFromO2Kine.randomphi=true;GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName=/path/to/evtpool.root\"\n     ```\n   - By default, events are randomized with the same seed per timeframe, but not phi-randomized.

Use the following scripts:\n   - `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`: Defines the MC job logic and configuration.\n   - `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`: Executes the workflow on a compute node.\n\n   These scripts allow you to run end-to-end simulations with proper separation of transport and digitization stages.\n\n3. **Leverage Configuration Files:**\n   Configuration is supported via:\n   - Pre-defined parameter classes.\n   - INI or text configuration files.\n   - Clear separation between transport (o2-sim) and digitization steps.\n\n4. **Important Notes:**\n   - Events are processed in complete isolation (no global time frame concept\u2014this is introduced during digitization).\n   - `o2-sim` generates three internal log files for debugging:\n     - `o2sim_serverlog`\n     - `o2sim_workerlog0`\n     - `o2sim_mergerlog`\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [O2DPG MC Workflows Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py)\n- [ALICE Run3 Simulation Tutorial (PDF)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf)\n- [o2-sim Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)",

            "To perform only event generation in the O2 simulation framework, you can use `o2-sim` with the appropriate generator and configuration to skip physics transport and detector simulation. Here are the recommended approaches based on the provided context:\n\n### 1. **Using `o2-sim` with Pythia8 (simplest method)**\nRun `o2-sim` with the `pythia8` generator and configure it to skip transport and physics simulation.\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --configFile only_primarykine.ini\n```\n\n- `-n 10`: Generate 10 events.\n- `-g pythia8pp`: Use Pythia8 for proton-proton collisions (you can use other generators like `pythia8pp` or `pythia8PbPb`).\n- `--configFile only_primarykine.ini`: This configuration file disables physics and geometry processing to ensure only event generation occurs.\n\nThe `only_primarykine.ini` file (available in the `run/SimExamples/JustPrimaryKinematics/` directory) is specifically designed for this purpose. It sets:\n- `Physics.processingMode = 0` (skips physics and transport).\n- Geometry cuts are set tightly so that no simulation work is performed.\n\n> \u2705 This method produces only the primary particle kinematics in `o2sim_Kine.root` without any detector interaction or transport.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Using `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to generate event pools (for large-scale generation)**\nIf you need to generate many events and merge them into a single file (e.g., for analysis or embedding), use the O2DPG workflow with `--make-evtpool`.\n\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM 14000 -col pp -gen pythia8 -proc cdiff -tf 2 -ns 5000 --make-evtpool -seed 546 -o evtpool\n```\n\n- `-gen pythia8`: Use Pythia8 as the event generator.\n- `--make-evtpool`: Skips all steps after event generation and merges the kinematic files into `evtpool.root`.\n- The output is a single file (`evtpool.root`) containing all generated events.\n\n> \u2705 This is ideal for generating large event pools without transport.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Using `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` for DPL-based event generation**\nFor integration with the DPL framework (e.g., in O2DPG workflows), use `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` with the `extkinO2` generator.\n\n```bash\no2-sim-dpl-eventgen -b --nevents 10 --generator extkinO2 --confKeyValues \"GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName=o2sim_Kine.root\" --vertexMode kNoVertex\n```\n\n> \u2705 Use this if you're embedding or chaining event generation within a DPL workflow.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Method | Use Case | Output |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| `o2-sim -g pythia8pp --configFile only_primarykine.ini` | Simple single-run event generation | `o2sim_Kine.root` |\n| `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py --make-evtpool` | Large-scale event pool generation | `evtpool.root` |\n| `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` | DPL-based workflows | Streamed events (e.g., for embedding) |\n\n---\n\n### References:\n- [JustPrimaryKinematics Example](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/JustPrimaryKinematics/run.sh)\n- [O2DPG Event Pool Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/event_pool.sh)\n- [O2DPG Workflow Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py)\n\nThese methods allow you to generate events **without** any detector simulation or transport.",
            "To perform only event generation in O2 simulation (without subsequent transport, physics interaction, or digitization), you can use the `o2-sim` tool with specific configuration options to skip the simulation steps after event generation.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\n1. **Use `o2-sim` with a generator (e.g., Pythia8 or HepMC)**:\n   - Choose your event generator (e.g., `pythia8`, `epos4`, `starlight`, or external kinematics).\n   - Use the `--configFile` option to configure the simulation to skip transport and physics.\n\n2. **Configure `o2-sim` to generate only primary kinematics**:\n   - Set very tight geometry cuts so that Geant4 does not perform any transport.\n   - Disable physics interaction and tracking.\n\nExample using Pythia8 to generate only primary particles (as shown in the [JustPrimaryKinematics example](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/JustPrimaryKinematics/run.sh)):\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -m CAVE --configFile only_primarykine.ini\n```\n\nThe `only_primarykine.ini` file (example provided in the repository) contains settings to:\n- Disable physics processes (`PhysicsProcess=0`).\n- Set tight geometry cuts so that no particle transport occurs.\n- Save only the generated primary particles.\n\nThis results in the generation of events (primary particles) without any simulation of their interaction with the detector material or transport through the detector.\n\n> \u2705 **Key point**: Use `--configFile` with a configuration that disables physics and transport, and use generators like `pythia8`, `epos4`, or `extkin` (for external kinematics).\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [JustPrimaryKinematics README](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/JustPrimaryKinematics/run.sh)\n- [Generator documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)",
            "To perform only event generation with `o2-sim`, you can use the `pythia8pp` generator and configure `o2-sim` to skip transport and physics simulation. The recommended approach is to use a configuration file that disables physics and sets tight geometry cuts to prevent Geant from processing particles.\n\nFor example, use the `only_primarykine.ini` configuration file (as shown in the [JustPrimaryKinematics example](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/JustPrimaryKinematics/run.sh)):\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -m CAVE --configFile only_primarykine.ini\n```\n\nThis command generates 10 primary events using Pythia8 for pp collisions and saves only the generated kinematics (without transport or physics interaction). The output is stored in `o2sim_Kine.root`, which contains the primary particle information (vertices, momenta, etc.) as a pure generator output.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [O2 Analysis Tutorial (Nov2024)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf) and the [JustPrimaryKinematics example](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/JustPrimaryKinematics/run.sh).",
            "To perform only event generation with `o2-sim`, you can use the `--noGeant` flag to skip the detector simulation and transport steps, ensuring that only the event generation (primary particle collisions) is executed. Additionally, you can specify the generator and number of events using the `-g` and `-n` options.\n\nFor example, to generate 10 default Pythia8 pp events without any further simulation:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --noGeant\n```\n\nThis command generates the events using the Pythia8 generator and outputs the kinematic information (e.g., particle momenta, vertices) to a file named `o2sim_Kine.root`, along with metadata in `o2sim_MCHeader.root`.\n\nThe `--noGeant` flag ensures that no geometry, transport, or hit creation steps are performed, making it suitable for pure event generation.\n\nFor more details on available generators and options, run:\n```bash\no2-sim --help\n```\n\nSource: [O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf), [O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)",

The key is to skip the transport and simulation stages by using the `--make-evtpool` flag or by configuring the workflow to stop after event generation.\n\n### Method 1: Using `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` with `--make-evtpool`\nThis is the recommended approach for generating an event pool without transport.\n\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n  -eCM 14000 \\\n  -col pp \\\n  -gen pythia8 \\\n  -proc cdiff \\\n  -tf 2 \\\n  --ns 5000 \\\n  --make-evtpool \\\n  -seed 546 \\\n  -interactionRate 500000 \\\n  -productionTag \"evtpoolcreation\" \\\n  -o evtpool\n```\n\n- `-gen pythia8`: Selects Pythia8 as the event generator.\n- `--make-evtpool`: Ensures that the workflow stops after event generation and merges all kinematic files into `evtpool.root`.\n- `--ns 5000`: Number of events to generate.\n- `--make-evtpool` skips all simulation steps (transport, digitization, etc.).\n\nThe output will be `evtpool.root` containing the generated events.\n\n### Method 2: Using `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` (for custom generators)\nIf you want to use a custom generator (e.g., `extkinO2`), you can use the `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` tool:\n\n```bash\no2-sim-dpl-eventgen \\\n  -b \\\n  --nevents 10 \\\n  --generator extkinO2 \\\n  --confKeyValues \"GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName=o2sim_Kine.root\" \\\n  --vertexMode kNoVertex\n```\n\nThis generates 10 events from a pre-existing kinematic file (`o2sim_Kine.root`) and outputs them in the expected format.\n\n> **Note**: This method does **not** perform transport or detector simulation \u2014 it only generates events.\n\n### Summary\nTo do **only event generation**:\n- Use `--make-evtpool` with `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` for Pythia8 or other supported generators.\n- Use `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` with a generator like `extkinO2` for custom kinematic input.\n\nThe output will be kinematic files (e.g., `evtpool.root` or `o2sim_Kine.root`) with primary particle information, suitable for analysis or further processing.\n\n> For more details, refer to:\n> - [O2DPG Workflow Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/event_pool.sh)\n> - [Pythia8 Configuration Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/Pythia8/README.md)"

This method allows you to simulate only certain detectors by selectively transporting particles through them.\n\nFor example, in the `sim.ini` file, set:\n\n```ini\n[Stack]\ntransportPrimary=external\ntransportPrimaryFileName=transportPDG.macro\ntransportPrimaryFuncName=transportPDG(321)\ntransportPrimaryInvert=false\n```\n\nThis configures the simulation to only transport particles with PDG code 321 (e.g., kaons), and only their interactions in the detectors where they are allowed.

The `MCKinematicsReader` class provides functionality to retrieve tracks based on their MC label, allowing users to perform detailed analysis on specific particles or families.\n\nFor example, in code:\n```cpp\nstd::vector<MCTrack> const& tracks = reader.getTracks(event);\n// Access tracks by MC label\nauto track = reader.getTrackByLabel(label);\n```\n\nThe use of MC labels is integral to the simulation workflow and is preserved across all stages \u2014 from the initial event generation (e.g., via Pythia8) through to final analysis products.

            "MCTruth refers to the Monte Carlo truth information generated during the ALICE O2 simulation, primarily handled through the `o2::MCTrack` class. This class stores detailed kinematic and topological information about particles produced in the simulation, including their creation vertices, momenta, PDG codes, production mechanisms, and mother-daughter relationships. \n\nThe `MCTrack` objects are stored in a TTree within a ROOT file (typically `o2sim_Kine.root`), with one entry per event containing a vector of tracks. This data is generated by the `o2-sim` tool, which simulates particle production (via generators like Pythia8) and their transport through the ALICE detector system. The simulation can be configured to include or skip certain detector modules and field settings.\n\nKey functionalities of MCTruth include:\n- Tracking particle origins: The `o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator::getMother()` function retrieves the direct mother particle of a given track, while `getFirstPrimary()` identifies the original primary particle in the event.\n- Pruning: By default, only relevant particles are kept in the output to reduce data size.\n- Metadata: Additional event-level information (e.g., impact parameter for PbPb collisions) is stored in a separate file (`o2sim_MCHeader.root`).\n\nThus, MCTruth provides a lightweight, efficient, and comprehensive record of all simulated particle interactions, essential for physics analysis and detector response studies.\n\nFor further details, refer to the official documentation:  \n- [MCKinematicsReader Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md)  \n- [O2 Analysis Tutorial (April 2023)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)",

            "MCTruth is a system in the ALICE O2 simulation framework that associates detector digits (energy deposits) with their originating Monte Carlo (MC) particles. It works by maintaining a dedicated container called `MCTruthContainer`, which stores mappings between digits and MC track labels. Each label in this container is an `MCCompLabel` object that encodes the track ID, event ID, and source kinematics file ID, allowing precise reconstruction of the particle's origin.\n\nThis approach ensures that digits are stored efficiently, close to raw data, while enabling association with multiple MC labels (e.g., primary particles, mothers, or ancestors) without significant memory overhead. The `MCTruthContainer` is written as a separate branch in the output file alongside the digit data, making it easy to reconstruct the full MC truth information during analysis.\n\nFor example, in code, one can retrieve the mother or primary ancestor of a track using utilities like `o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator::getMother()` and `o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator::getFirstPrimary()`, which rely on the `MCCompLabel` information to trace particle origins.\n\nReference: [AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)",
