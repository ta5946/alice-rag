            "To run a simple simulation at generation level using O2, you can use the `o2-sim` executable with the `-g` flag to specify the generator and the `-n` flag to set the number of events. For example, to generate 10 default Pythia8 pp events, you would run:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp\n```\n\nThis command generates 10 events using the Pythia8 pp generator and simulates their passage through the ALICE detector. If you want to skip the Geant3 simulation (i.e., only generate particles without full detector simulation), use the `--noGeant` flag:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --noGeant\n```\n\nFor more advanced configurations, such as using external generators or custom setup, you can use the `--configKeyValues` option to pass additional parameters (e.g., specifying a custom generator function or configuration file).

            "To create and use event pools in the ALICE O2 framework, follow these steps:\n\n### Creating an Event Pool\n\n1. **Use the `--make-evtpool` flag** in the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script to generate an event pool.\n2. Specify the necessary parameters such as center-of-mass energy (`-eCM`), collision type (`-col`), generator (`-gen`), number of timeframes (`-tf`), and number of events (`--ns`).\n3. The workflow will skip all simulation steps after event generation (no transport) and merge all kinematic root files (`Kine.root`) from the timeframes into a single `evtpool.root` file.\n\n**Example command:**\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM 14000 -col pp -gen pythia8 -proc cdiff -tf 2 -ns 5000 --make-evtpool -seed 546 -interactionRate 500000 -productionTag \"evtpoolcreation\" -o evtpool\n```\n\nThis command creates an event pool with 5000 events, 2 timeframes, using Pythia8 for event generation.\n\n### Using an Event Pool\n\n1. **Run the workflow with the `pool` task** using `o2dpg_workflow_runner.py` to ensure the workflow reaches the `poolmerge` step:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt pool\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the event pool as input** in a simulation workflow by setting the generator to `extkinO2` and specifying the path to the `evtpool.root` file:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM 14000 -gen extkinO2 -tf 2 --ns 1000 \\\n       -confKey \"GeneratorFromO2Kine.randomphi=true;GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName=/path/to/evtpool.root\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Note**: By default, events from the pool are randomized with the same seed per timeframe, but **phi-angle randomization is not active** unless explicitly enabled via `randomphi=true`.\n\nFor more details, refer to the official documentation:\n- [O2DPG Workflow README \u2013 Event Pools](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [Example Script: event_pool.sh](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/event_pool.sh)",

It steers event generation, constructs the detector geometry and material and performs particle-transport simulation via a Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) abstraction so users can choose Geant4, Geant3 or FLUKA as backend. `o2-sim` produces hit files for each sensitive detector (e.g. `o2sim_HitsITS.root`) and a kinematics file (by default `o2sim_Kine.root`) containing primary and secondary particle information. For Run3 it is fully multi-core capable and asynchronous. Full documentation and examples are available in the provided links, and the O2DPG repository provides the integrated/official MC workflow.",

The minimal command requires specifying the generator and beam energies:\n\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen <generator> -eCM <collision energy in GeV>\n```\n\nor for asymmetric beams:\n\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen <generator> -eA <beam A energy in GeV> -eB <beam B energy in GeV>\n```\n\n#### Example: Simulate 14 TeV pp collisions with Pythia8\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen pythia8 -eCM 14000 -col pp -tf 5 -ns 2000 -interactionRate 500000 -run 302000\n```\n\n- `-gen pythia8`: Use Pythia8 as the event generator.\n- `-eCM 14000`: Center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV.\n- `-col pp`: Proton-proton collision system.\n- `-tf 5`: 5 timeframes.\n- `-ns 2000`: 2000 events per timeframe.\n- `-interactionRate 500000`: Interaction rate of 500 kHz.\n- `-run 302000`: Run number (required for CCDB condition retrieval).\n\n> \u2705 **Note**: The run number is mandatory, even for non-data-taking simulations, as it determines timestamps for fetching detector conditions from the CCDB.\n\n### 2. **Customize Pythia8 parameters (optional)**\nYou can pass a Pythia8 configuration file using:\n```bash\n--configKeyValues \"GeneratorPythia8.config=<path/to/pythia8_config.dat>\"\n```\n\nExample config file:\n```text\n### beams\nBeams:idA 2212\nBeams:idB 2212\nBeams:eCM 14000.\n\n### processes\nSoftQCD:inelastic on\n\n### decays\nParticleDecays:limitTau0 on\nParticleDecays:tau0Max 10.\n```\n\n### 3. **Run the workflow**\nAfter generating the `workflow.json`, use the workflow runner:\n```bash\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py workflow.json\n```\n\nThis executes all tasks defined in the workflow.\n\n### 4. **Optional: Use `o2dpg-workflow-tools.py` for workflow management**\nTo create an empty workflow file:\n```bash\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg-workflow-tools.py create my_workflow\n```\n\n### Prerequisites:\n- Valid ALICE GRID token (obtain via `alien-token-init`).\n- Environment loaded with `alienv` (e.g., `alienv enter O2/latest`).\n- At least 16 GB RAM and 8-core machine.\n\nFor detailed help:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py --help\n```\n\n---\n\n### References:\n- [O2DPG MC Workflow Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/README.md)\n- [O2DPG Simulation Tutorial (April 2023)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)\n- [o2-sim Usage Examples](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/gettingstarted/README.md)",

For example:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --configKeyValues \"GeneratorPythia8.config=pythia8_config.ini\"\n     ```\n   - Use `--configFile` to load a configuration file (e.g., `o2sim_configuration.ini`).\n\n2. **Generate a default configuration file**:\n   Run an empty simulation to generate a list of all available parameters and their default values:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE\n   ```\n   This produces `o2sim_configuration.ini`.\n\n3. **Modify detector geometry and material parameters**:\n   - For passive modules, use text files in `Detectors/Passive/data` (e.g., for material properties).\n   - To modify media parameters on the fly:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim-serial -n0 --configKeyValues \"MaterialManagerParam.outputFile=o2_medium_params.json\"\n     ```\n     Edit `o2_medium_params.json` and inject it back:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim --configKeyValues \"MaterialManagerParam.inputFile=o2_medium_params_modified.json\" -n 10 -g pythia8pp\n     ```\n\n4. **Use the workflow script `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`**:\n   This script configures the full MC workflow. Example:\n   ```bash\n   o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen pythia8 -ini path/to/custom_config.ini\n   ```\n   - Custom configuration files (`.ini`) can be placed in `O2DPG/MC/config/<PWG>/ini/`.\n   - The environment variable `O2DPG_MC_CONFIG_ROOT` links to the official configuration folder.\n\n5. **Set physics processes and cuts**:\n   - Use `--configKeyValues \"MCReplayParam.energyCut=0.1\"` to set minimum energy cut.\n   - Switch physics processes on/off via `SetCuts.cxx` (default settings in `Detectors/gconfig/src/`).\n\n6. **Select event generator and physics model**:\n   - Use `-g pythia8pp` for pp collisions.\n   - Choose transport engine: `-e TGeant4`, `-e TGeant3`, or `-e FLUKA`.\n   - Skip modules: `--skipModules ZDC,PHS`.\n\n7. **Run on GRID**:\n   Obtain an alien token with:\n   ```bash\n   alien-token-init\n   ```\n   Ensure `alienv` environment is loaded.\n\nFor detailed documentation, refer to:\n- [ALICE O2 Simulation Docs](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/README.md)\n- [O2DPG MC Workflow Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/README.md)\n- [Pythia8 Configuration Example](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorso2.md)",

This framework handles the full simulation workflow, from event generation to AOD creation and analysis.\n\n### Key Steps to Configure ALICE Run3 Simulation:\n\n1. **Use `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` Script**:\n   - This Python script in the O2DPG repository configures the Monte Carlo workflow based on user-defined parameters.\n   - Example parameters include:\n     - Collision system (e.g., `pp`, `PbPb`)\n     - Event generator (e.g., `pythia8pp`)\n     - Number of timeframes and events per timeframe\n     - Interaction rate\n     - Run number\n\n   **Example command**:\n   ```bash\n   python3 o2dpg_sim_workflow.py --collision-system pp --event-generator pythia8pp --n-timeframes 5 --events-per-timeframe 2000 --run-number 12345\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Workflow with `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`**:\n   - After generating the workflow configuration, execute it using this runner script, which manages the job execution on compute nodes (e.g., on the GRID).\n\n3. **Configure Simulation Parameters**:\n   - Use configurable parameters via:\n     - `--configFile`: Specify a configuration file.\n     - `--configKeyValues`: Set key-value pairs directly on the command line.\n   - The default parameters are listed in `o2sim_configuration.ini`, which can be generated using:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE\n     ```\n\n4. **Choose Physics Model (Geant Engine)**:\n   - ALICE Run3 supports **Geant4**, **Geant3**, and **FLUKA** via the Virtual Monte Carlo API.\n   - Select via the `-e` flag:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -e TGeant3\n     ```\n\n5. **Optional: Skip Detectors or Customize Geometry**:\n   - Skip specific detector modules using `--skipModules`:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --skipModules ZDC\n     ```\n   - Set magnetic field strength with `-f` or `--field` (e.g., `--field 2` for 2 kGauss).\n\n### References:\n- Official MC workflow setup: [O2DPG Repository](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG)\n- Documentation: [AliceO2 Simulation Docs](https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/)\n- Configuration guide: [Configurable Parameters](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/Common/SimConfig/doc/ConfigurableParam.md)\n\nThis setup ensures reproducibility and integration into the official ALICE Run3 data production pipeline."

Use the `-g` flag to select your desired generator (e.g., `pythia8pp` for proton-proton collisions).\n2. Use the `--noGeant` option to disable the transport simulation and physics interactions.\n3. Optionally, use `--configFile` to customize the behavior (e.g., to skip unnecessary modules).\n\n### Example command:\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --noGeant -o events\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Generates 10 events using the Pythia8pp generator.\n- Skips all transport and physics simulation (`--noGeant`).\n- Outputs the primary kinematics (generated particles) to a file (e.g., `events.root`).\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The output contains the generated primary particles without any detector effects or hits.\n- If you want to save only the primary kinematics without any simulation at all, you can also use the `extkinO2` generator in conjunction with `--configFile` to read back and write only kinematics, as shown in the example:  \n  ```bash\n  o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -m CAVE --configFile only_primarykine.ini\n  ```\n\nFor more details, refer to the [O2 simulation documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf) and the [O2DPG generator configuration guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorso2.md).",
            "To perform only event generation (i.e., generate primary particles without any subsequent transport or detector simulation), use the `o2-sim` tool with a configuration that disables physics and transport.\n\nThe recommended approach is to use the `only_primarykine.ini` configuration file, which disables physics processes and sets tight geometry cuts so that no particle transport occurs. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -m CAVE --configFile only_primarykine.ini\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Generates 10 Pythia8 pp events (`-n 10 -g pythia8pp`),\n- Uses the `CAVE` (or `O2`) geometry (`-m CAVE`),\n- Applies the `only_primarykine.ini` configuration to skip transport and physics interactions,\n- Outputs the generated primary kinematics to `o2sim_Kine.root` (default file).\n\nThe resulting `o2sim_Kine.root` file contains only the primary particles as generated by the event generator (e.g., Pythia8), without any secondary particles or detector effects.\n\nFor reference:  \n- [Example: Just Primary Kinematics (GitHub)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/JustPrimaryKinematics/run.sh)",
            "To perform only event generation with `o2-sim`, you can use the `--noGeant` flag to skip the physics simulation and detector transport steps. This allows `o2-sim` to generate events using the specified generator (e.g., Pythia8) and save the primary particle kinematics without further processing.\n\nFor example, to generate 10 default Pythia8 proton-proton events and save only the generated kinematics (without transport or hits), use:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --noGeant\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Uses the Pythia8 pp generator (`-g pythia8pp`)\n- Generates 10 events (`-n 10`)\n- Skips the Geant-based simulation and transport (`--noGeant`)\n- Outputs the primary particle kinematics to `o2sim_Kine.root` by default\n\nFor more control, you can also use the `--configFile` option with a configuration that disables unnecessary components (e.g., geometry or detector modules), as shown in the example [here](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/JustPrimaryKinematics/run.sh).\n\nThis approach is suitable for generating pure event output (e.g., for analysis or as input for other simulations)."

            "To simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline, you can use the `--skipModules` option in the `o2-sim` command. This option allows you to skip the simulation of specific detectors by providing a comma-separated list of detector names.\n\nFor example, to simulate only the ITS and TPC detectors while skipping the others (e.g., ZDC, PHOS), you would use:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -e TGeant4 --skipModules ZDC,PHOS,EMCAL,FT0,FMD\n```\n\nThis command runs 10 events with Pythia8 for pp collisions, uses Geant4 for transport, and skips the specified detectors.\n\nAlternatively, when using the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script, you can achieve the same result by configuring the workflow to skip unwanted detectors. The workflow file (e.g., `workflow.json`) can be edited to include a `skipModules` parameter in the simulation task. For instance:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": \"sim\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"skipModules\": \"ZDC,PHOS,EMCAL,FT0,FMD\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that only the desired detectors are simulated, reducing computational load and focusing on specific detector response studies.\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [o2-sim documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/README.md)\n- [O2DPG MC Workflow Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/README.md)",

The framework uses specific tables like `McParticle` to store this information and provides tools to link reconstructed data (e.g., tracks) with their corresponding MC truth particles through index columns, such as `McTrackLabels` and `McCollisionLabels`. Tasks like `AccessMCTruth` demonstrate how to access this information by joining reconstructed tables with MC truth tables using `soa::Join`. For more details, refer to the [O2 Analysis Framework documentation on MC data](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/analysis-framework/blob/master/docs/tutorials/workingWithMCdata.md).",
            "MCTruth refers to the Monte Carlo truth information generated during the simulation process in ALICE O2, primarily through the `o2-sim` executable. This information is stored in the `o2::MCTrack` class, which is a lightweight alternative to ROOT's `TParticle` class, designed for efficient memory and disk usage.\n\nThe `o2-sim` program simulates particle interactions within the detector geometry, including event generation, particle transport, and energy deposition (hits). A key output of this process is the kinematics data, stored in a ROOT TTree in the file `o2sim_Kine.root` by default. For each event, this contains a vector of `MCTrack` objects that represent both primary particles (generated by the event generator, e.g., Pythia8) and secondary particles produced during transport (e.g., via decays or interactions).\n\nEach `MCTrack` stores essential kinematic and origin information, such as:\n- Production vertex (`Vx`, `Vy`, `Vz`) and production time (`Vt`),\n- Momentum vector in x, y, z directions (`PVector`) in GeV/c,\n- Whether the particle was produced by the generator (`ProducedByGenerator` flag),\n- Whether it originated from a background event (`FromBackgroundEvent`),\n- Mother-daughter relationships (allowing reconstruction of particle decay chains),\n- Generator status codes (`getGenStatusCode`).\n\nThis data enables detailed physics analysis by tracking particle origins and interactions throughout the detector. The `MCTrack` data is accessible via tools like ROOT's JSRoot or TBrowser, and can be analyzed using utilities such as `MCTrackNavigator` to trace particle histories (e.g., finding mothers or first primaries).\n\nThe kinematics output is pruned by default to keep only relevant particles, and additional event-level metadata (e.g., impact parameter for PbPb collisions) is stored separately in `o2sim_MCHeader.root`.\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [ALICE O2 Simulation Tutorial (April 2023)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)\n- [ALICE O2 Analysis Framework - Data Model](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/analysis-framework/blob/master/docs/datamodel/ao2dTables.md)",
            "The `MCTrack` class in the ALICE O2 simulation framework is a lightweight representation of Monte Carlo particle tracks used to store kinematic and tracking information during the simulation process. It is designed to be more memory- and disk-efficient than ROOT's `TParticle` class.\n\n`MCTrack` stores essential particle properties such as:\n\n- **Creation vertex (x, y, z, t)**: The spatial and temporal coordinates where the particle was produced (e.g., from a primary collision or a secondary interaction).\n- **Momentum (Px, Py, Pz)**: The 3D momentum components of the particle in GeV/c.\n- **Particle ID (PDG code)**: Identifies the type of particle (e.g., proton, pion).\n- **Status flags**: Indicates whether the particle was produced by the generator (primary) or by the transport simulation (secondary), and whether it originates from a background event.\n- **Mother-daughter relationships**: Tracks the production history of particles (e.g., which particle decayed into this one), enabling reconstruction of the physics processes.\n\nThe `MCTrack` class is used to store simulated particle information in a `TTree` (in the `o2sim_Kine.root` file), with one entry per event containing a `std::vector<MCTrack>` that holds all the generated and secondary particles. This data is used for physics analysis and includes information on the physics process, progenitor relationships, and event-level metadata (stored in `o2sim_MCHeader.root`).\n\nFor example, using the `MCTrackNavigator` utilities, one can trace the production history of a particle back to its primary ancestor or examine its decay chain.\n\nThe `MCTrack` class is central to the simulation output and enables detailed analysis of particle origins, interactions, and kinematics in the detector.\n\nSource: [O2 MC Tutorial (April 2023)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)",
            "MCTruth refers to the Monte Carlo truth information generated during the simulation process in the ALICE O2 framework. It captures the complete history of particles produced in a simulated collision, including their creation vertices, momenta, production time, and their relationships (e.g., mother-daughter) through the physics interactions and transport simulations. This information is stored in the `o2::MCTrack` class, which is a lightweight alternative to ROOT's TParticle, designed for efficient memory and disk usage.\n\nThe main output of the `o2-sim` program, known as the kinematics output (`o2sim_Kine.root`), contains a `TTree` with a vector of `MCTrack` objects for each event. These tracks include primary particles generated by the event generator (e.g., Pythia8) and secondary particles created during the transport through the detector material. Key attributes of each track include:\n- `vz`: Z production vertex in cm\n- `vt`: Production time\n- `pVector`: Momentum vector in x, y, z directions (in GeV/c)\n- `producedByGenerator`: Boolean indicating whether the particle was produced by the generator (primary) or during transport (secondary)\n- `fromBackgroundEvent`: Boolean indicating if the particle originated from a background event\n- `getGenStatusCode` and `getHepMCStatusCode`: Status codes from the generator\n- `getProcess`: Physics process code (e.g., from TMCProcess.h)\n\nThe MC truth information is used to correlate reconstructed particles (from detector digitization and reconstruction) with their original simulated counterparts. This is achieved via label columns (e.g., `McTrackLabels`, `McCollisionLabels`) that link reconstructed objects to their MC truth counterparts in the analysis framework. Tasks like `AccessMCTruth` demonstrate how to retrieve the MC particle associated with a reconstructed track by joining the reconstructed and MC truth tables.\n\nIn summary, MCTruth provides a detailed, traceable record of all particles in a simulated event, enabling precise validation of reconstruction and analysis procedures.\n\nFor more details, see:\n- [O2 Analysis Tutorial - MC Truth Access](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/analysis-framework/blob/master/docs/tutorials/workingWithMCdata.md)\n- [O2 Simulation Tutorial - Kinematics Output](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf)\n- [O2 Data Model - MCParticle Table](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/analysis-framework/blob/master/docs/datamodel/ao2dTables.md)"
