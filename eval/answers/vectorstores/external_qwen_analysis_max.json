            "To run a simple simulation at generation level in O2, you can use the `o2-sim` command with the `-g` flag to specify the generator and the `-n` flag to set the number of events. For example, to run 100 events using the Pythia8 pp generator, you would execute:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -g pythia8pp -n 100\n```\n\nThis command uses the default configuration for the `pythia8pp` generator. If you need to customize the simulation (e.g., change the center-of-mass energy or include additional parameters), you can use the `--configKeyValues` flag to set specific parameters, such as:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -g pythia8pp -n 100 --configKeyValues \"GeneratorPythia8.eCM=13000\"\n```\n\nFor more advanced configuration, you can also use a configuration file with `--configFile` or specify parameters directly via the command line.\n\nMore details can be found in the official documentation:\n- [O2DPG Simulation Examples](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/README.md)\n- [Generator Configuration](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorconfig.md)",

For more advanced configurations, you can use additional flags like `--configKeyValues` or provide a configuration file (e.g., `.ini` or `.json`) to customize generator settings.\n\nFor examples using other generators like `hybrid`, `HepMC`, or `EPOS4`, refer to the provided scripts in the O2 repository, such as those in `run/SimExamples/Hybrid/` or `run/SimExamples/HepMC_JETSCAPE/`.\n\nReferences:\n- [O2 Simulation Getting Started](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/gettingstarted/README.md)\n- [Generators in O2](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorso2.md)\n- [Example: Pythia8pp simulation](https://github.com/ta5946/alice-rag/blob/master/data/knowledge_base/presentations/MC_Tutorials.pdf)",

This process is known as **embedding** and is commonly used to simulate pile-up or background events.\n\nWhen using this option, the interaction vertex of the new event is forced to match that of the background event (stored in `o2sim.background.root`). The background events are sampled one-by-one and reused once all have been used.\n\nExample command:\n```\no2-sim --embedIntoFile o2sim.background.root\n```\n\nThis enables combining particles from different sources (e.g., signal and background) within the same event, effectively merging them for analysis.\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [O2 Detector Simulation documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)\n- [O2 Simulation Generators documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorso2.md)",

            "The tool used to run a test production on the GRID using the user's quota is the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script, which is part of the O2DPG framework. This script allows users to create and configure a simulation workflow for testing purposes before requesting full production.\n\n### How it works:\n1. **Workflow Creation**: The user runs the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script with required parameters such as:\n   - `-gen`: the event generator (e.g., `pythia8`, `external`).\n   - `-eCM`: center-of-mass energy in GeV (e.g., `-eCM 13600` for Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV).\n   - `-col`: collision type (`pp`, `PbPb`, etc.).\n   - `-j`: number of workers (typically 8 for GRID).\n   - `-ns`: number of signal events.\n   - `-tf`: number of time frames.\n   - `-ini`: path to a configuration file (`.ini`) defining generator-specific settings.\n   - `-mod`: optional module-specific flags (e.g., `--skipModules ZDC`).\n   - `-seed`: optional seed for reproducibility.\n\n   Example command:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen pythia8 -eCM 13600 -col pp -j 8 -ns 1 -tf 1 -ini $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/config/PWGHF/ini/GeneratorHFTrigger_ccbar.ini\n   ```\n\n2. **Test Execution**: The workflow is executed locally or on `lxplus` first (as recommended), using the `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` script:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json\n   ```\n   This runs the simulation up to the desired stage (e.g., `aod`), and allows users to validate outputs.\n\n3. **GRID Submission**: Once validated, the job is submitted to the GRID using `grid_submit.sh`, which manages the job description (JDL), resource allocation, and submission. The script supports:\n   - `--prodsplit`: controls how many splits the production is divided into.\n   - `--asuser`: sets the GRID username if different from local user.\n   - `--ttl`: sets job lifetime.\n   - `--dry-run`: tests submission without actual job submission.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: Users must respect default GRID resources (8-core CPU, 16 GB RAM). The workflow runner can enforce limits using:\n   - `--mem-limit <MB>`\n   - `--cpu-limit <number of CPUs>`\n   - Example: `--mem-limit 16000` to limit memory to 16 GB.\n\n5. **Output Handling**: The system automatically downloads output files (e.g., `.root` files) after job completion. Users specify which files to keep using replica specifiers like `tf*/*.root@disk=2`.\n\n6. **Quota Usage**: The test production runs under the user\u2019s allocated quota. The `grid_submit.sh` script ensures that resource usage stays within limits and respects the user's quota.\n\n> \u2705 **Best Practice**: Always test locally or on `lxplus` first before submitting to the GRID to avoid quota overuse or failed jobs.\n\nFor further details, refer to:\n- [O2DPG Workflow Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [GRID Production Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/gridproductions/README.md)\n- [Example Workflow Scripts](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/README.md)"

To proceed further (e.g., digitization, reconstruction, and analysis), you would need to use the full O2DPG workflow, as described in the official ALICE Run3 simulation documentation.\n\nFor more advanced configurations, you can:\n- Use multiple cores with `--nThreads` or `-j` (e.g., `-j 8` for 8 parallel workers).\n- Skip specific detector modules (e.g., `--skipModules ZDC`).\n- Use a different transport engine (e.g., `--field 2 -e TGeant3` to use Geant3 with a 2 kGauss L3 field).\n\nFor a complete simulation pipeline (including digitization, reconstruction, and AOD creation), use the **O2DPG** workflow system:\n- Repository: [https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG)\n- Script: `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`\n\nFor documentation, refer to:\n- [https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/](https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/)\n- [https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)",
            "To run a basic ALICE detector simulation for Run3, you can use the `o2-sim` executable, which is the particle-detector simulator for ALICE Run3. It handles event generation, particle transport through the detector using Geant4, Geant3, or FLUKA (via the Virtual Monte Carlo API), and the creation of hits (energy deposits) as a precursor to digitization.\n\n### Basic Steps:\n\n1. **Set up your environment**:\n   - Use CVMFS or build the O2Sim package locally.\n   - Source the O2 environment (e.g., `source /cvmfs/alice.cern.ch/etc/profile.d/setup.sh`).\n\n2. **Run a simple simulation**:\n   Use the `o2-sim` command with basic parameters. For example, to generate 10 default Pythia8 proton-proton (pp) events and simulate their passage through the full ALICE detector:\n\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp\n   ```\n\n   - `-n 10`: Generate 10 events.\n   - `-g pythia8pp`: Use Pythia8 to generate pp collisions at 14 TeV.\n\n3. **Optional parameters**:\n   - Use `-j N` to enable multi-core simulation with N worker threads (e.g., `-j 8`).\n   - Skip specific detectors (e.g., `--skipModules ZDC`) if needed.\n   - Set magnetic field strength with `--field 2` (2 kGauss).\n   - Use a different transport engine (e.g., `-e TGeant3` for Geant3).\n\n   Example:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8 --skipModules ZDC --field 2 -e TGeant3\n   ```\n\n4. **Advanced: Full simulation pipeline using O2DPG**:\n   For a complete simulation including digitization, reconstruction, and AOD production, use the **O2DPG** framework:\n   - Use `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to generate a workflow configuration.\n   - Run with `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`.\n\n   Example command:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n     -eCM 14000 \\\n     -col pp \\\n     -gen pythia8 \\\n     -proc cdiff \\\n     -tf 5 \\\n     -ns 2000 \\\n     -interactionRate 500000 \\\n     -run 302000\n   ```\n\n   This creates a 5-timeframe simulation with 2000 events per timeframe, 500 kHz interaction rate, and a run number (required for CCDB access).\n\n### Output:\n- The simulation produces:\n  - `geometry.root`: detector geometry.\n  - `kinematics.root`: primary particle kinematics.\n  - `hits.root`: energy deposits (hits) from particle interactions.\n- These are inputs for the next stage: digitization (`o2-sim-digitizer-workflow`).\n\n### Useful Links:\n- [O2DPG MC Workflows](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py)\n- [o2-sim Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)\n- [O2 Analysis Tutorial (Nov 2024)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf)\n\n> **Note**: For full production-level simulations (digitization, reconstruction, QC, analysis), use O2DPG.

For example:\n   ```bash\n   $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n     -gen pythia8pp \\\n     -eCM 14 \\\n     -n 1000 \\\n     -tf 5 \\\n     -ev 2000 \\\n     -run 100000 \\\n     -o workflow.json\n   ```\n   - `-gen`: Event generator (e.g., `pythia8pp`, `pythia8aa`, `lhc13pp`).\n   - `-eCM`: Center-of-mass energy in GeV (e.g., 14 for pp collisions).\n   - `-n`: Number of events.\n   - `-tf`: Number of timeframes.\n   - `-ev`: Events per timeframe.\n   - `-run`: Run number.\n   - `-o`: Output workflow file (e.g., `workflow.json`).\n\n3. **Run the workflow**:\n   Execute the generated workflow using:\n   ```bash\n   $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py workflow.json\n   ```\n\n4. **(Optional) Add QC tasks**:\n   If you want to include quality control (QC) tasks, you can modify the workflow file using:\n   ```bash\n   $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg-workflow-tools.py add-qc workflow.json\n   ```\n\n5. **(For GRID production)**:\n   Use the official GRID interface via AliEn. Official large-scale MC productions should be submitted through the **Data Processing Group (DPG)** using the WLCG (Worldwide LHC Computing Grid). See [MC GRID productions](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/gridproductions/README.md) for submission instructions.\n\n> \u2705 **Important**: The O2DPG repository integrates all parts (event generation, simulation, digitization, reconstruction, QC, analysis) into a consistent pipeline. This ensures reproducibility and proper configuration propagation across the full DPL (Data Processing Layer) topology.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 References:\n- [O2DPG MC README](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/README.md)\n- [Workflow creation guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [MC GRID productions](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/gridproductions/README.md)",

            "To run Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in ALICE O2, you need to use two main scripts provided by the O2DPG framework:\n\n1. **`o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`** \u2013 This script sets up the MC workflow by configuring the simulation parameters (e.g., collision system, generator, number of timeframes, interaction rate, etc.) and generates a `workflow.json` file that defines the task graph.\n\n2. **`o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`** \u2013 This script executes the tasks defined in the `workflow.json` file.\n\n### Steps to Run MC in ALICE3 (O2DPG):\n\n#### 1. **Set up the environment**\n```bash\nalienv enter O2sim/latest\n```\n\n#### 2. **Create a workflow using `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`**\n\nExample command for a 14 TeV pp collision simulation with Pythia8, 5 timeframes, 2000 events per timeframe, and an interaction rate of 500 kHz:\n```bash\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n  -col pp \\\n  -eCM 14000 \\\n  -gen pythia8 \\\n  -proc cdiff \\\n  -tf 5 \\\n  -ns 2000 \\\n  -interactionRate 500000 \\\n  -run 302000 \\\n  -o workflow.json\n```\n\n> **Note**: The `-run` number is mandatory as it determines the timestamp for fetching conditions from the CCDB.\n\n#### 3. **Run the workflow using `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`**\n```bash\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py workflow.json\n```\n\n> You can also set the local CCDB cache path if needed:\n> ```bash\n> ALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE=/path/to/cache o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py workflow.json\n> ```\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- For custom generator configurations, use the `--configFile` or `-ini` option with a valid `.ini` file stored in the O2DPG repository.\n- The workflow creation and execution are decoupled to allow flexible configuration and execution on the GRID.\n\nFor full documentation:\n- [O2DPG MC Workflow Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/README.md)\n- [O2DPG MC README](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/README.md)\n- [O2DPG MC Workflow Tools](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/o2dpg-workflow-tools.py)",
            "To run Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in ALICE O2 (ALICE3), you need to follow a two-step process: **workflow creation** and **workflow execution**. The main scripts involved are:\n\n1. **`o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`** \u2013 This script creates a JSON workflow file describing the MC job as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks, including event generation, simulation, digitization, reconstruction, and optionally QC or analysis.\n2. **`o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`** \u2013 This script executes the tasks defined in the workflow file using a dynamic scheduler.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step 1: Create the Workflow (using `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`)\n\nRun the following command to generate a workflow for a 14 TeV pp collision simulation with Pythia8, 5 timeframes, 2000 events per timeframe, and an interaction rate of 500 kHz:\n\n```bash\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n  -gen pythia8 \\\n  -col pp \\\n  -eCM 14000 \\\n  -tf 5 \\\n  -ns 2000 \\\n  -interactionRate 500000 \\\n  -run 302000 \\\n  -proc cdiff \\\n  -field 2 \\\n  -seed 12345\n```\n\n#### \ud83d\udd11 Key Parameters:\n- `-gen`: Event generator (e.g., `pythia8`, `epos`, `qgsjet`)\n- `-col`: Collision system (`pp`, `pPb`, `PbPb`, etc.)\n- `-eCM`: Center-of-mass energy in GeV (e.g., `14000` for 14 TeV)\n- `-tf`: Number of timeframes\n- `-ns`: Number of events per timeframe\n- `-interactionRate`: Interaction rate in Hz (e.g., `500000` for 500 kHz)\n- `-run`: Run number (required for CCDB access; even for MC)\n- `-proc`: Specific process (e.g., `cdiff` for colour-diffusion)\n- `-field`: Magnetic field strength (in kGauss; e.g., `2` for L3 field)\n- `-seed`: Random seed for reproducibility\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 **Note**: The `run` number is mandatory, even for simulations not tied to real data taking, because it determines the timestamp for fetching conditions from the CCDB.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step 2: Execute the Workflow (using `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`)\n\nAfter generating `workflow.json`, run the workflow:\n\n```bash\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py workflow.json\n```\n\nThis will:\n- Parse the DAG\n- Execute tasks in the correct order\n- Handle dependencies and resource allocation\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Requirements:\n> - At least **16 GB RAM** and **8 cores**\n> - A valid **GRID token** (for accessing CCDB via alien)\n> - O2DPG environment properly sourced (e.g., `alienv load O2DPG/latest`)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Additional Notes\n\n- **Workflow Management**: Use `o2dpg-workflow-tools.py` for editing or inspecting workflow files:\n  ```bash\n  $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg-workflow-tools.py create my_workflow\n  $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg-workflow-tools.py add-task my_workflow.json --task sim\n  ```\n\n- **Documentation Links**:\n  - [O2DPG MC Workflow Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/README.md)\n  - [O2DPG Workflow README](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Example: Minimal Working Workflow\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Create workflow\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen pythia8 -col pp -eCM 14000 -tf 1 -ns 10 -run 302000 -interactionRate 500000\n\n# Step 2: Run it\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py workflow.json\n```\n\nThis will simulate 10 events in one timeframe with minimal configuration.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 You now have a complete MC workflow for ALICE Run3 using O2DPG."

ConfigurableParams are two-level key-value strings `MainKey.SubKey=Value` passed via the `--configKeyValues` option; the main key addresses a broader category and the sub-key a specific modifiable variable. Example configurable parameter: `G4Params.configMacroFile` to set a Geant4 input file. Full example: `o2-sim -e TGeant4 --configKeyValues=\"G4Params.configMacroFile=myG4config.in\"`.

The script generates a `workflow.json` file that describes the task graph to be executed.\n\nFor direct simulation using `o2-sim`, you can configure the simulation via command-line arguments. For example:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8 --skipModules ZDC --field 2 -e TGeant3\n```\n\nThis command generates 10 Pythia8 proton-proton events, uses 8 worker processes, skips the ZDC detector, applies an L3 magnetic field of 2 kGauss, and uses Geant3 for transport.\n\nTo customize event generation further (e.g., for Pythia8), you can provide a configuration file using the `--configKeyValues` option:\n\n```bash\n--configKeyValues \"GeneratorPythia8.config=<path/to/config>\"\n```\n\nConfiguration files for generators are typically located in `O2DPG/MC/config/<PWG>/ini/<config>.ini`.

            "To configure ALICE MC (Monte Carlo) simulations, you can use the O2DPG framework, which manages the workflow and integration of all components in the simulation pipeline. Here's how to proceed:\n\n### 1. **Use `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to create a workflow**\nThis Python script is used to configure the Monte Carlo workflow by specifying key parameters. The minimal command requires the generator and beam energies:\n\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen <generator> -eCM <center-of-mass energy in GeV>\n```\n\nor for asymmetric beams:\n\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen <generator> -eA <beam A energy in GeV> -eB <beam B energy in GeV>\n```\n\n**Example** (for 14 TeV pp collisions):\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen pythia8pp -eCM 14000\n```\n\nThis generates a `workflow.json` file describing the task graph.\n\n### 2. **Configure the Event Generator (e.g., Pythia8)**\nPythia8 requires a configuration file. You can pass it using `--configKeyValues`:\n\n```bash\n--configKeyValues \"GeneratorPythia8.config=<path/to/pythia8_config.ini>\"\n```\n\nExample config (`pythia8_config.ini`):\n```ini\n### beams\nBeams:idA 2212\nBeams:idB 2212\nBeams:eCM 14000.\n\n### processes\nSoftQCD:inelastic on\n\n### decays\nParticleDecays:limitTau0 on\nParticleDecays:tau0Max 10.\n```\n\n### 3. **Run the Simulation with `o2-sim`**\nUse the `o2-sim` tool to simulate events. It handles geometry, event generation, particle transport (via Geant4/Geant3/FLUKA), and hit creation.\n\n**Basic usage**:\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -e TGeant4 -j 2 --skipModules ZDC,PHS\n```\n\n- `-n 10`: 10 events\n- `-g pythia8pp`: use Pythia8 for pp collisions\n- `-e TGeant4`: use Geant4 for transport\n- `-j 2`: use 2 parallel workers\n- `--skipModules ZDC,PHS`: skip ZDC and PHOS detectors\n\n### 4. **Use Configuration Files**\nGenerator configurations are stored in:\n```\nO2DPG/MC/config/<PWG>/ini/<config>.ini\n```\n\nSee: [Generator configuration guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorconfig.md)\n\n### 5. **Run the Workflow**\nAfter generating `workflow.json`, execute it using:\n```bash\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py workflow.json\n```\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites:\n- Valid **Alien GRID token**: Run `alien-token-init` after loading the `alienv` environment.\n- At least **16 GB RAM** and **8 cores** recommended.\n- Build O2 and O2DPG with `aliBuild`.\n\nFor more details:\n- [O2DPG MC Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [Pythia8 Configuration](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorso2.md)\n- [ALICE Run3 MC Tutorial (April 2023)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)"

Run the following command:\n\n```bash\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n  -eCM 14000 \\\n  -col pp \\\n  -gen pythia8 \\\n  -proc cdiff \\\n  -tf 5 \\\n  -ns 2000 \\\n  -interactionRate 500000 \\\n  -run 302000 \\\n  -o workflow.json\n```\n\n#### Key parameters:\n- `-eCM`: Center-of-mass energy (e.g., 14000 for 14 TeV pp).\n- `-col`: Collision system (e.g., `pp`, `PbPb`).\n- `-gen`: Event generator (e.g., `pythia8`).\n- `-proc`: Specific process (e.g., `cdiff` for central diffraction).\n- `-tf`: Number of timeframes.\n- `-ns`: Number of events per timeframe.\n- `-interactionRate`: Interaction rate in Hz (e.g., 500000 for 500 kHz).\n- `-run`: Run number (mandatory; used for timestamp and CCDB conditions).\n- `-o`: Output workflow file (e.g., `workflow.json`).\n\n> **Note:** The `run` number is mandatory even for non-data-taking simulations, as it determines timestamps for CCDB conditions.\n\n### 2. **Run the workflow using `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`**\nAfter creating the workflow file, execute it with the runner script:\n\n```bash\n$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py workflow.json\n```\n\nThis runs the full pipeline:\n- Event generation (via `o2-sim`)\n- Transport simulation (Geant4/Geant3/FLUKA)\n- Digitization\n- Reconstruction\n- AOD creation\n- Optional QC and analysis\n\n### 3. **Use `o2-sim` directly for basic simulation**\nIf you only need the transport simulation (event generation + detector response), use `o2-sim` directly:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8 --skipModules ZDC --field 2 -e TGeant3\n```\n\n- `-n 10`: Generate 10 events.\n- `-g pythia8pp`: Use Pythia8 for pp collisions (default).\n- `-j 8`: Use 8 cores (multi-core parallelism).\n- `--skipModules ZDC`: Skip the ZDC detector.\n- `--field 2`: Apply 2 kGauss magnetic field.\n- `-e TGeant3`: Use Geant3 instead of Geant4.\n\n> **Important**: `o2-sim` treats events in isolation; timeframe concept starts at digitization.\n\n### 4. **Configure simulation parameters**\nYou can customize simulation behavior using:\n- `--configKeyValues key=value`: Set parameters at runtime.\n- `--configFile`: Load a configuration file (e.g., `.ini`).\n- The file `o2sim_configuration.ini` (produced by `o2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE`) lists all configurable parameters.\n\n### Documentation & Resources\n- Official simulation docs: [https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/](https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/)\n- O2DPG MC workflow guide: [O2DPG MC Workflow README](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/README.md)\n- Generator documentation: [Generators in O2](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorso2.md)\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Summary**: Use `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to define your simulation workflow with key physics and detector parameters. Then run it with `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` for a full end-to-end simulation. For simpler tasks, directly use `o2-sim` with command-line options.",
            "To configure ALICE Run3 simulation, you should use the **O2DPG framework**, which provides the official and integrated setup for MC productions. The key steps and tools are:\n\n1. **Use `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`** to create a simulation workflow:\n   - This script generates a `workflow.json` file that defines the entire MC pipeline.\n   - You specify essential parameters such as:\n     - Event generator (`-gen pythia8pp`, `-gen herwigpp`, etc.)\n     - Center-of-mass energy (`-eCM 14` for 14 TeV pp collisions)\n     - Number of events (`-n 1000`)\n     - Number of timeframes (`-t 5`)\n     - Interaction rate, run number, etc.\n\n   Example command:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen pythia8pp -eCM 14 -n 1000 -t 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`** to execute the workflow:\n   - This script runs the tasks defined in `workflow.json` on a compute node.\n   - It handles dependencies and ensures consistent configuration across all stages (simulation, digitization, reconstruction, etc.).\n\n3. **Configure parameters via config files or command-line options**:\n   - Use `--configFile` or `--configKeyValues` to override default simulation parameters.\n   - The complete list of configurable parameters can be inspected in the `o2sim_configuration.ini` file generated by running:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE\n     ```\n\n4. **Key simulation tool: `o2-sim`**:\n   - This is the core particle detector simulator for ALICE Run3.\n   - It supports multiple transport engines: Geant4 (default), Geant3, and FLUKA via the Virtual Monte Carlo API.\n   - It simulates event generation, particle transport, hit creation, and more.\n\n5. **Additional tools**:\n   - Use `$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg-workflow-tools.py` to manage workflow files (e.g., create, edit, inspect).\n   - Ensure you have a valid GRID token to access CCDB objects (required for some simulations).\n\nFor detailed documentation, refer to:\n- [O2DPG MC Workflows Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/README.md)\n- [ALICE Run3 MC How-To (Tutorial)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)\n- [Official Simulation Documentation](https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/)\n\nThis setup enables full simulation from event generation to AOD, including digitization and reconstruction, and is suitable for both small-scale testing and large-scale GRID production.",

This setup handles the entire workflow from event generation to AOD creation, including digitization, reconstruction, and analysis.\n\n### Key Steps to Configure ALICE Run3 Simulation:\n\n1. **Use `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`**  \n   This Python script is the primary tool for configuring your Monte Carlo (MC) workflow. It generates a complete simulation workflow based on user-defined parameters.\n\n   **Example command:**\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n     -eCM 14000 \\\n     -col pp \\\n     -gen pythia8 \\\n     -proc cdiff \\\n     -tf 5 \\\n     -ns 2000 \\\n     -interactionRate 500000 \\\n     -run 302000\n   ```\n   - `-eCM`: Center-of-mass energy (e.g., 14000 for 14 TeV pp).\n   - `-col`: Collision system (e.g., `pp`, `PbPb`).\n   - `-gen`: Event generator (e.g., `pythia8`).\n   - `-proc`: Specific process (e.g., `cdiff` for color-diffusion).\n   - `-tf`: Number of timeframes.\n   - `-ns`: Number of events per timeframe.\n   - `-interactionRate`: Interaction rate (in Hz).\n   - `-run`: Run number (mandatory for CCDB condition retrieval).\n\n2. **Run the Workflow with `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`**  \n   After generating the workflow, use the runner script to execute it:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py \\\n     --workflow-file workflow.json \\\n     --run 302000 \\\n     --n-events 10000\n   ```\n\n3. **Understand the Simulation Pipeline**  \n   The full pipeline includes:\n   - **Event generation**: Using tools like Pythia8.\n   - **Transport simulation**: Done by `o2-sim` with Geant4, Geant3, or FLUKA.\n   - **Digitization**: Via `o2-sim-digitizer-workflow`.\n   - **Reconstruction, QC, and Analysis**: Integrated in O2DPG.\n\n4. **Use `o2-sim` for Standalone Simulation**  \n   For basic simulation (e.g., transport only), use `o2-sim` directly:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8 --skipModules ZDC --field 2 -e TGeant3\n   ```\n   - `-n`: Number of events.\n   - `-g`: Generator (e.g., `pythia8pp`).\n   - `-j`: Number of workers (for sub-event parallelism).\n   - `--skipModules`: Skip specific detectors (e.g., ZDC).\n   - `--field`: Magnetic field strength (e.g., 2 kG).\n   - `-e`: Transport engine (e.g., `TGeant3`).\n\n5. **Configuration Files**  \n   Configuration is managed via:\n   - **INI/text files**\n   - **Pre-defined parameter classes**\n   - **Command-line arguments** (as shown above)\n\n6. **Important Notes:**\n   - `o2-sim` treats events in isolation (no timeframe concept \u2014 this is introduced during digitization).\n   - The system uses **sub-event parallelism** for scalable, multi-core simulation.\n   - Use **run numbers** for consistency and CCDB access.\n\n### Documentation & Support:\n- Official Docs: [https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/](https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/)\n- O2DPG Repository: [https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG)\n- Mattermost Channels: `O2-simulation`, `O2DPG`\n- JIRA: For bug reports and feature requests\n\n> \u2705 **Recommendation**: For production or complex workflows, always use the O2DPG framework to ensure consistency, reproducibility, and integration with official data-taking pipelines.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**:  \n- [O2DPG MC Workflows](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG)  \n- [ALICE Run3 MC HowTo (April 2023)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo.pdf)  \n- [ALICE Run3 Simulation Tutorial (Nov 2024)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf)",

However, direct access is discouraged; instead, dynamic columns like `getGenStatusCode()` or `producedByGenerator()` should be used.\n\n- **Parent-Child Relationships**:\n  - The `getMother()` function from `o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator` allows retrieval of the direct mother particle (parent) of a given track.\n  - The `getFirstPrimary()` function traces back to the first primary particle (originally generated by the event generator), which is crucial for identifying the origin of secondary particles.\n\n- **MC Track Navigation**: The `MCKinematicsReader` class (from `o2::simulation`) reads MC kinematics files (e.g., `o2sim_MCKine.root`) and provides access to all tracks via `getTracks(event)`.

            "To access MC tracks given a MC label in the O2 simulation framework, use the `MCKinematicsReader` class, which provides a method to retrieve tracks associated with a specific Monte Carlo label.\n\nThe `MCKinematicsReader` can be initialized with a context file (e.g., `collisioncontext.root`) or a simulation prefix (e.g., `\"o2sim\"`). Once initialized, the `getTracks()` method can be used with a MC label to retrieve the corresponding track(s). The method signature is:\n\n```cpp\nstd::vector<MCTrack> const& tracks = reader.getTracks(mcLabel);\n```\n\nHere, `mcLabel` is the identifier associated with a specific Monte Carlo track (e.g., a unique ID from the `MCCompLabel` or `McParticleId`).\n\nFor more advanced navigation (e.g., finding mother-daughter relationships), you can use the `MCTrackNavigator` class, which provides utility functions such as:\n\n```cpp\nauto mother = o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator::getMother(track, allTracks);\nauto primary = o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator::getFirstPrimary(track, allTracks);\n```\n\nThese tools are designed to simplify access and navigation through MC kinematics data.\n\nFor detailed information, refer to the official O2 documentation:\n- [MCKinematicsReader Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md)\n- [Analysis Tutorial (Nov 2024)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf)",
            "To access MC tracks given an MC label in the ALICE O2 framework, you can use the `MCKinematicsReader` class, which provides a method to retrieve tracks associated with a specific MC label. The `getTracks` method of `MCKinematicsReader` can be used with a given MC label to retrieve the corresponding `MCTrack` objects.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Initialize the `MCKinematicsReader`**:\n   The reader is initialized with a context file (e.g., `collisioncontext.root`) generated during digitization:\n   ```cpp\n   o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader reader(\"collisioncontext.root\");\n   ```\n\n2. **Retrieve tracks using an MC label**:\n   The `MCKinematicsReader` supports retrieving tracks by a given MC label. Although the exact method signature for label-based access is not explicitly shown in the context, the `getTracks` method is known to support label-based lookup. You can use:\n   ```cpp\n   std::vector<MCTrack> const& tracks = reader.getTracks(event); // by event\n   ```\n   For label-specific access, the label is typically part of the `MCCompLabel` class, which encapsulates track ID, event ID, and source ID. You can use the label to look up the track via the reader.\n\n3. **Use `MCCompLabel`**:\n   The `MCCompLabel` object contains the track ID, event ID, and source ID. These identifiers are sufficient to resolve and load the specific Monte Carlo track:\n   ```cpp\n   MCCompLabel label(trackID, eventID, sourceID);\n   ```\n   You can then use the reader to access the track associated with this label.\n\n4. **Retrieve the track**:\n   While the context does not provide the exact `getTrackByLabel` method, the `MCKinematicsReader` is designed to retrieve tracks for a given event or label. The intended usage would be:\n   ```cpp\n   auto track = reader.getTrackByLabel(label); // hypothetical method\n   ```\n\nFor detailed usage and available methods, refer to:\n- [MCKinematicsReader documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md)\n- [MCCompLabel class](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)\n\n> **Note**: The exact method to access a track via a label may require using `getTracks` in combination with the label's track ID, or using `MCTrackNavigator` to resolve the track from the pool of available tracks. For example:\n```cpp\nauto track = std::find_if(tracks.begin(), tracks.end(), [&](const auto& t) {\n    return t.getTrackId() == label.getTrackId();\n});\n```\n\nThis approach assumes the track is part of the current event's track list.\n\nFor further details, see:\n- [MCKinematicsReader](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md)\n- [MCCompLabel](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)"

            "To access `TrackReferences`, you need to use the `o2::aod::TrackSelection` table, which contains references to tracks and their selection status. This table is typically filled by running the `o2-analysis-trackselection` task. Once the task is executed, you can access `TrackReferences` via the `TrackSelection` table in your analysis workflow.\n\nFor example, in your analysis task, you can access it as follows:\n\n```cpp\nvoid process(o2::aod::TrackSelection const& trackSelection)\n{\n  for (auto& trackRef : trackSelection) {\n    // Access track reference\n    auto track = trackRef.trackAs<o2::aod::TracksIU>();\n    // Process the track as needed\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `TrackSelection` table is created by the `o2-analysis-trackselection` task, which must be run before your analysis task.

However, based on the structure of the Alice O2 analysis framework and the referenced tables (e.g., `Tracks`, `TracksExtra`, `TrackSelectionExtension`), access to track references would typically be handled through the `o2::aod::Tracks` table and its associated extensions.\n\nTo access track references, you would generally:\n1. Use the `o2::aod::Tracks` table (or `o2::aod::FullTracks` which includes `TracksExtra`).\n2. Access track reference information via the `o2::aod::track::TrackType` or other related fields, depending on the specific reference data.\n3. If the references are stored in an extension table (e.g., via `soa::Join`), ensure that the appropriate extension is included in your analysis task.\n\nFor precise access, consult the relevant header files (e.g., `Framework/Core/include/Framework/AnalysisDataModel.h` or `Common/DataModel/TrackSelectionTables.h`) or refer to specific tutorials, such as [histogramTrackSelection.cxx](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2Physics/blob/master/Tutorials/src/histogramTrackSelection.cxx), which show how track selections and extensions are used.\n\nIf `TrackReferences` is a custom or less common table, it may require additional setup or be defined in a specific analysis task.",
            "To access TrackReferences in the O2 analysis framework, you need to use the appropriate table that contains the track references, typically through the `o2::aod::Tracks` table or its joined variants.
