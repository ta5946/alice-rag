            "To run a simple simulation at generation level in O2, you need to use the `anchorMC.sh` script provided in the O2DPG framework. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Set the number of workers (e.g., `export NWORKERS=4`).\n2. Define the generator configuration using an `.ini` file by setting `CONFIGNAME` to the appropriate configuration file (e.g., `Generator_GapTriggered_LFgamma_np1_gap2.ini`).\n3. Set the simulation options via `ALIEN_JDL_ANCHOR_SIM_OPTIONS`, specifying the generator type and the path to the `.ini` file:\n   ```bash\n   export ALIEN_JDL_ANCHOR_SIM_OPTIONS=\"-gen external -ini $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/config/PWGEM/ini/$CONFIGNAME\"\n   ```\n4. Run the central anchor steering script:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/run/ANCHOR/anchorMC.sh\n   ```\n\nThis script handles:\n- Deriving the timestamp\n- Deriving the interaction rate\n- Extracting and preparing detector configurations\n- Running the simulation (and optionally quality checks)\n\nFor a minimal setup, ensure that:\n- The required `.ini` file exists in the specified directory.\n- The environment variables are properly set (especially `O2DPG_ROOT`).\n- QC is disabled if not needed by uncommenting `export DISABLE_QC=1`.\n\nFor reference, see the example scripts in the O2DPG repository:  \n- [runAnchoredPythia8GapTriggeredLFgamma_pp_np1_gap2.sh](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/PWGEM/runAnchoredPythia8GapTriggeredLFgamma_pp_np1_gap2.sh)  \n- [runAnchoredPythia8GapTriggeredLFee_pp_np1_gap5.sh](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/PWGEM/runAnchoredPythia8GapTriggeredLFee_pp_np1_gap5.sh)",
            "To run a simple simulation at the generation level, use the `o2-sim` command with the `-g` flag to specify the generator type, along with other necessary options. For a basic setup, you can run:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -g <generator> -n <number_of_events> --noGeant\n```\n\nReplace `<generator>` with the desired generator (e.g., `hybrid`, `tparticle`, `external`, etc.) and `<number_of_events>` with the number of events you want to simulate.\n\nFor example, using the hybrid generator with 100 events:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -g hybrid -n 100 --noGeant\n```\n\nAdditional configuration can be provided via `--configKeyValues` or `--configFile` depending on the generator. See the documentation for specific generator requirements.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [O2 simulation examples](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/Hybrid/runo2sim.sh) and [HepMC generation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/HepMC/README.md) guides.",
            "To run a simple simulation at generation level in O2, you can use the `o2-sim` command with the appropriate generator and configuration. Here\u2019s a basic workflow:\n\n1. **Ensure the environment is set up**: Load the O2 and O2DPG environments using `alienv enter`.\n\n2. **Prepare a configuration file**: Use the script `${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_hybrid_gen.py` to generate a template configuration file (e.g., `hybridconfig.json`) by specifying the desired generator(s) via the `gen` flag:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_hybrid_gen.py -gen pythia8\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the simulation** using `o2-sim` with the `-g` flag to specify the generator and the `--configFile` to point to your configuration file. For a simple simulation with no Geant4 tracking (`--noGeant`), example command:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -g hybrid --configFile hybridconfig.json --noGeant -n 100 -j 4\n   ```\n\n   - `-n 100`: Generate 100 events.\n   - `-j 4`: Use 4 parallel jobs.\n   - `--noGeant`: Skip the Geant4 simulation step (for generation-level only).\n   - `--configFile hybridconfig.json`: Load the generator configuration.\n\nThis setup runs the simulation at the generation level using a pre-configured generator (e.g., Pythia8 via hybrid generator) and produces simulated primary particles without further propagation.\n\nFor more advanced setups (e.g., external generators), refer to the `o2-sim` documentation or examples in `run/SimExamples/HepMC` or `run/SimExamples/TParticle`.\n\nSource: [O2DPG Hybrid Generator Template](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorso2.md), [O2 Simulation Examples](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/Hybrid/runo2sim.sh)",
            "To run a simple simulation at generation level using the Hybrid generator, you can use the `runo2sim.sh` script provided in the O2 simulation examples. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. Ensure your environment is set up with O2 and O2DPG loaded:\n   ```bash\n   alienv enter O2/latest\n   ```\n\n2. Use the `runo2sim.sh` script with the appropriate options:\n   ```bash\n   ./runo2sim.sh -n 1\n   ```\n   - `-n 1`: Specifies the number of events to simulate (here, 1 event).\n   - The script uses a configuration file (`hybridconfig.json`) to define the generator settings.\n   - The simulation is run with `o2-sim` using the `hybrid` generator, no GEANT simulation (`--noGeant`), and the output is written to `genevents.root`.\n\n3. The command executed internally is:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2_ROOT}/bin/o2-sim --noGeant -j 2 --field ccdb --vertexMode kCCDB --run 300000 --configKeyValues \"MFTBase.buildAlignment=true;GeneratorHybrid.configFile=$PWD/hybridconfig.json;GeneratorHybrid.randomize=false;${more}\" -g hybrid -o genevents --timestamp 1546300800000 --seed 836302859 -n 1\n   ```\n\nThe `hybridconfig.json` file must be present in the directory and properly configured with generator settings (e.g., particle types, kinematic cuts, etc.). You can generate a template using:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_hybrid_gen.py -gen pythia8,geant4\n```\n\nFor a minimal setup, ensure you have the script and config file ready, then run:\n```bash\n./runo2sim.sh -n 1\n```\n\nThis will run a single event simulation using the Hybrid generator.\n\nSource: [O2 Hybrid Simulation Example](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/Hybrid/runo2sim.sh)",
            "To run a simple simulation at the generation level in the ALICE O2 framework, you can use the `o2-sim` command with appropriate flags. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. **Basic command**:  \n   Run `o2-sim` with the generator type and desired options. For example, to generate 100 events using Pythia8:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -g pythia8 -n 100 -j 4\n   ```\n   - `-g pythia8`: Specifies the generator (e.g., pythia8, EPOS4, etc.).\n   - `-n 100`: Sets the number of events to generate.\n   - `-j 4`: Sets the number of parallel jobs (workers).\n\n2. **Use configuration files**:  \n   You can pass a configuration file (`.ini`) using:\n   ```bash\n   --configFile myconfig.ini\n   ```\n   This allows you to define detailed generator settings.\n\n3. **Set parameters via command line**:  \n   Use `--configKeyValues` to set specific parameters directly:\n   ```bash\n   --configKeyValues \"GeneratorPythia8.includePartonEvent=true\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Skip Geant transport (generation only)**:  \n   To generate only generator kinematics (skip full detector simulation), use:\n   ```bash\n   --noGeant\n   ```\n\n5. **Set random seed**:  \n   To ensure reproducibility:\n   ```bash\n   --seed 12345\n   ```\n\n6. **Custom output prefix**:  \n   Change the output file prefix:\n   ```bash\n   -o mySimulation\n   ```\n\nFor a full list of available options, run:\n```bash\no2-sim --help\n```\n\n> **Note**: Ensure that the O2DPG and O2 environments are loaded (e.g., via `alienv enter`), as shown in the example scripts.\n\nFor example, from the `runAdaptive_Pythia8/run.sh` script:\n```bash\no2-sim -j 20 -n 5 -g pythia8hi -m PIPE ITS -o bkg --configKeyValues \"Diamond.position[2]=0.1;Diamond.width[2]=0.05\"\n```\n\nThis runs a simulation with 5 events, using Pythia8hi generator, 20 jobs, and specific configuration values.\n\n[Source: ALICE O2 Documentation \u2013 SimExamples](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/Adaptive_Pythia8/run.sh)"

This generates a JSON workflow that skips the AOD creation and, instead, moves to a *poolmerge* step that merges the output from the various timeframes generated into a single `evtpool.root` file.\nAn easy example is:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen pythia8pp -eCM 13000 -tf 8 -ns 100 --make-evtpool -interactionRate 500000 -seed 123\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt pool\n```\nThe generated file can later be used via the `evtpool` generator that allows multiple events reading customisations (round-robin, randomisation etc.) and is compatible with either local paths or alien ones, making it extremely versatile. A configuration example using the hybrid generator is:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\": \"evtpool\",\n  \"config\": {\n    \"eventPoolPath\": \"alien:///alice/sim/2025/EP25f1/2\",\n    \"skipNonTrackable\": true,\n    \"roundRobin\": false,\n    \"randomize\": true,\n    \"rngseed\": 0,\n    \"randomphi\": false\n  }\n}\n```",

            "To create and use event pools in the O2 simulation framework, follow these steps:\n\n### Creating an Event Pool\n1. Use the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script with the `--make-evtpool` flag to generate an event pool.\n2. Specify the required parameters such as collision energy (`-eCM`), beam type (`-col`), generator (`-gen`), number of timeframes (`-tf`), number of events (`-ns`), and other relevant options.\n3. Example command:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM 14000 -col pp -gen pythia8 -proc cdiff -tf 2 -ns 5000 --make-evtpool -seed 546 -interactionRate 500000 -productionTag \"evtpoolcreation\" -o evtpool\n   ```\n   - This generates `evtpool.root` in the current directory by merging all Kine.root files from the timeframes.\n   - The workflow skips transport steps and stops at `poolmerge`.\n\n4.

            "Yes, there is a simple mechanism to combine particles from different generators for each event using the **hybrid generator** feature in O2 simulation. This allows multiple generators (e.g., Pythia8pp, Pythia8hi, or external kinematics files) to be combined within a single event by defining a configuration file (e.g., `hybridconfig.json`) that specifies the generators and their contributions.\n\nYou can use the `hybrid` generator with the `-g hybrid` option and specify the configuration file via the `--configKeyValues \"GeneratorHybrid.configFile=...\"` parameter. This enables the simulation to run multiple generator clones in parallel or sequentially, combining their output into one event.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\no2-sim -g hybrid --configKeyValues \"GeneratorHybrid.configFile=hybridconfig.json\" -n 100\n```\n\nAdditionally, for embedding background events (e.g., from a previously generated file like `o2sim.background.root`), you can use:\n```bash\no2-sim --embedIntoFile o2sim.background.root\n```\nThis ensures both the primary and background events originate from the same vertex and are merged correctly.\n\nSee:  \n- [O2 Hybrid Generator Example](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/Hybrid_parallel/run_parallel.sh)  \n- [Embedding Events](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)",
            "Yes, there is a simple mechanism to combine particles from different generators for each event using the `--embedIntoFile` option in `o2-sim`. This process, known as embedding, merges two independently generated events into a single event with the same interaction vertex. \n\nTo achieve this, you can use the command:\n```\no2-sim --embedIntoFile o2sim.background.root\n```\n\nThis command forces the interaction vertex of the new event to match that of the background events stored in `o2sim.background.root`. The background events are sampled one-by-one and reused after all have been processed.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [ALICE O2 Detector Simulation documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)."

            "To run the ALICE Run3 detector simulation, you can use the `o2-sim` executable, which is the particle-detector simulator for ALICE Run3. It handles event generation, particle transport through the detector using Geant4, Geant3, or FLUKA (via the Virtual Monte Carlo API), and the creation of hits (energy deposits) as a precursor to digitization.\n\n### Basic Steps to Run the Simulation:\n\n1. **Install the O2 software framework**:\n   Ensure you have the ALICE O2 framework set up. This includes building or installing the necessary components from the [AliceO2Group repositories](https://github.com/AliceO2Group).\n\n2. **Run `o2-sim` for basic simulation**:\n   Use the following command to generate and simulate 10 default Pythia8 pp events through the complete ALICE detector:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp\n   ```\n\n3. **Advanced options**:\n   - Use multiple cores with sub-event parallelism:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8\n     ```\n   - Skip specific detector modules (e.g., ZDC):\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8 --skipModules ZDC\n     ```\n   - Use a specific physics engine (e.g., TGeant3) and magnetic field:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8 --field 2 -e TGeant3\n     ```\n   - Disable Geant simulation entirely (for testing):\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --noGeant\n     ```\n\n4. **Use O2DPG for full simulation workflows**:\n   For integrated, official MC production (from event generation to AOD/analysis), use the [O2DPG repository](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG), which provides:\n   - `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`: Defines the full MC workflow.\n   - `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`: Executes the workflow on compute nodes.\n\n   Example usage:\n   ```bash\n   python3 o2dpg_sim_workflow.py --type mc --events 10 --generator pythia8pp --output-dir ./output\n   ```\n\n### Additional Resources:\n- [O2DPG MC Workflows Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [ALICE Run3 Simulation Tutorial (April 2023)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo.pdf)\n- [O2 Simulation Documentation](https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/)\n\n> Note: `o2-sim` treats events in isolation, with no concept of timeframes \u2014 this is introduced during digitization.\n\nFor more details, refer to the official documentation and community channels (Mattermost, JIRA, e-groups).",

Here\u2019s how to configure and run ALICE MC:\n\n### 1. **Basic Usage of `o2-sim`**\nUse the `o2-sim` command with various options to control the simulation.\n\n- **Generate 10 Pythia8 pp events and simulate through the full ALICE detector:**\n  ```bash\n  o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp\n  ```\n\n- **Use 8 parallel workers, skip ZDC and PHOS detectors, apply a 2 kGauss magnetic field, and use Geant3:**\n  ```bash\n  o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8 --skipModules ZDC PHOS --field 2 -e TGeant3\n  ```\n\n- **Only generate events without any simulation (pure generator output):**\n  ```bash\n  o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --noGeant\n  ```\n\n### 2. **Key Configuration Options**\n- `-n`, `--nEvents`: Number of events to generate (e.g., `-n 10`).\n- `-g`, `--generator`: Event generator (e.g., `pythia8pp` for proton-proton collisions).\n- `-j`, `--nworkers`: Number of parallel simulation workers (e.g., `-j 8`).\n- `--skipModules`: Skip specific detector modules (e.g., `ZDC`, `PHOS`).\n- `--field`: Magnetic field strength in kGauss (e.g., `--field 2` for 2 kGauss).\n- `-e`, `--engine`: Physics engine (e.g., `TGeant3`, `Geant4`, `FLUKA`).\n- `--noGeant`: Skip detector simulation and only produce generator output.\n- `--configFile`: Path to a configuration file (`.ini` or `.json`).\n- `--configKeyValues`: Set configuration parameters via key-value pairs (e.g., `TPC.gasDensity=1`).\n\n### 3. **Workflow Configuration (Advanced)**\nFor complex workflows, use the Python script `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` (part of O2DPG) to configure the MC workflow based on user parameters such as:\n- Collision system (e.g., pp, PbPb)\n- Event generator (e.g., Pythia8)\n- Number of timeframes and events per timeframe\n- Interaction rate\n- Run number\n\nExample command:\n```bash\npython o2dpg_sim_workflow.py --collisions pp --generator pythia8 --nTimeFrames 5 --nEventsPerTimeFrame 2000 --energy 14TeV\n```\n\n### 4. **Output Files Generated**\n- `o2sim_Kine.root`: Kinematics (primaries and secondaries) and event metadata.\n- `o2sim_geometry.root`: Final ROOT geometry used.\n- `o2sim_grp.root`: Global run parameters (e.g., magnetic field).\n- `o2sim_XXXHits.root`: Hit files for each active detector (e.g., TPC, ITS).\n\n### 5. **Further Help**\nRun `o2-sim --help` to see all available options and defaults.\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo.pdf](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo.pdf)\n- [O2DPG MC README](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/README.md)\n- [Detector Simulation Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)"

            "To configure ALICE Run3 simulation, you can use the `o2-sim` tool, which is the particle-detector simulator for ALICE Run3. It leverages well-known particle-transport engines such as Geant4, Geant3, and FLUKA via the Virtual Monte Carlo API.\n\n### Key Steps for Configuration:\n\n1. **Use `o2-sim` with configurable parameters**:\n   - The simulation uses configurable parameters defined in `ConfigurableParam.md`.\n   - Parameters can be set via configuration files (`--configFile`) or command-line options (`--configKeyValues`).\n   - The default configuration file `o2sim_configuration.ini` can be generated by running:  \n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE\n     ```\n\n2. **Define simulation components**:\n   - **Event generation**: Use the `-gen` option to select an event generator (e.g., `pythia8`, `tune`, `vajava`).\n   - **Collision system and energy**: Set with `-col` (e.g., `pp`, `PbPb`) and `-eCM` (e.g., `14000` for 14 TeV).\n   - **Interaction rate**: Specify with `-interactionRate` (e.g., `500000` for 500 kHz).\n   - **Number of events and timeframes**: Use `-n` (total events) and `-tf` (number of timeframes).\n   - **Run number**: Required for timestamping and CCDB access. Use `-run` (e.g., `302000`).\n   - **Detector modules**: Specify which detectors to simulate using `-m` or `--redoutDetectors`. Valid detectors are listed in [DetID.h](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/Detectors/Common/include/DetectorsCommonDataFormats/DetID.h).\n   - **Magnetic field**: Set with `-field` (e.g., `5.0` for 5 T).\n   - **Seed**: For reproducibility, use `-seed`.\n\n3. **Use O2DPG for full MC workflows**:\n   - The [O2DPG repository](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG) provides official workflows for Run3 MC production.\n   - Use the script `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to create a full simulation workflow:\n     ```bash\n     ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n       -eCM 14000 \\\n       -col pp \\\n       -gen pythia8 \\\n       -proc cdiff \\\n       -tf 5 \\\n       -ns 2000 \\\n       -interactionRate 500000 \\\n       -run 302000\n     ```\n     This generates a 5-timeframe simulation with 2000 events per timeframe for 14 TeV pp collisions using Pythia8 with the `cdiff` process.\n\n4. **Additional components**:\n   - After `o2-sim`, the pipeline continues with digitization, reconstruction, QC, and analysis.\n   - These are managed via O2DPG or `full-system-test`.\n\nFor detailed documentation, refer to:\n- [O2DPG MC Workflows](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [Transport Simulation README](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/README.md)\n- [Configurable Parameters](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/Common/SimConfig/doc/ConfigurableParam.md)\n\nThis setup enables a complete, reproducible, and configurable ALICE Run3 simulation workflow.",
            "To configure ALICE Run3 simulation, you can use the `o2-sim` tool, which is the primary particle-detector simulator for ALICE Run3. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the provided context:\n\n### 1. **Set Up the Software Environment**\n- For a **basic build** (with generators like Pythia8):\n  ```bash\n  aliBuild build O2 O2DPG --defaults o2\n  alienv enter O2/latest,O2DPG/latest\n  ```\n- For a **full build** (including all generators, QC, and O2Physics):\n  ```bash\n  aliBuild build O2sim --defaults o2\n  alienv enter O2sim/latest\n  ```\n- Use **nightly precompiled builds** via CVMFS:\n  ```bash\n  /cvmfs/alice.cern.ch/bin/alienv enter O2sim::v20241014-1\n  ```\n\n### 2. **Run `o2-sim` with Configuration Options**\nThe basic command structure is:\n```bash\no2-sim -n <number_of_events> -g <generator> [options]\n```\n\n#### Examples:\n- Generate 10 default Pythia8 pp events and simulate through the full ALICE detector:\n  ```bash\n  o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp\n  ```\n\n- Use 8 workers with Geant3, skip ZDC detector, and apply a 2 kGauss magnetic field:\n  ```bash\n  o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8 --skipModules ZDC --field 2 -e TGeant3\n  ```\n\n- Run simulation without Geant4 (e.g., for testing or specific workflows):\n  ```bash\n  o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --noGeant\n  ```\n\n### 3. **Key Configuration Parameters**\n- `-n`: Number of events to generate.\n- `-g`: Event generator (e.g., `pythia8pp`, `pythia8pp` for proton-proton collisions).\n- `-j`: Number of parallel workers (supports scalable multi-core simulation).\n- `--skipModules`: Skip specific detector modules (e.g., `ZDC`).\n- `--field`: Magnetic field strength (in kGauss; e.g., `2` for L3 field).\n- `-e`: Transport engine (`TGeant4`, `TGeant3`, `FLUKA`).\n\n### 4. **Use Environment Variables (Optional)**\nYou can fine-tune the simulation behavior using environment variables:\n- `ALICE_O2SIM_DUMPLOG`: Print all FairMQ component logs to screen.\n- `ALICE_NOSIMSHM`: Use ROOT serialization instead of shared memory for inter-process communication.\n\n### 5. **Output Files**\n`o2-sim` produces:\n- **Hits** (energy deposits) \u2013 primary output for digitization.\n- **Log files**: `o2sim_serverlog`, `o2sim_workerlog0`, `o2sim_mergerlog` (for debugging and monitoring).\n\n### 6. **Further Documentation**\n- Official documentation: [https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/](https://aliceo2group.github.io/simulation/)\n- Generator and engine details: [Generators](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/generators.md), [Engines](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/engines.md)\n- Examples: [`O2/SimExamples`](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/tree/main/SimExamples) or nightly tests.\n\n### 7. **Integration with Workflows**\n- Use **O2DPG** for physics studies on GRID.\n- Use **full-system-test** for data-taking-oriented simulations.\n- Integration and configuration of full MC workflows are managed via these repositories.\n\n> \ud83d\udccc **Note**: `o2-sim` treats events in isolation (no timeframe concept \u2014 this is introduced during digitization).\n\nFor more help, refer to the [ALICE Run3 MC How-To Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo.pdf) and provide feedback to the simulation team.",

            "In ALICE Run 3 simulation, a `MClabel` refers to a data structure used to associate simulated particles (tracks) with their true Monte Carlo (MC) origin. Specifically, it is encapsulated in the `MCCompLabel` class, which stores identifiers for the track, event, and source kinematics file. This allows for precise tracking and reconstruction of particle origins during simulation and analysis.\n\nThe `MCCompLabel` is used to link reconstructed objects (e.g., digits, tracks) back to their true MC particles, enabling accurate simulation-to-reconstruction matching. It is particularly important in the context of the `MCTruthContainer`, which stores these associations as a separate container in the output file, minimizing memory overhead while allowing multiple labels per digit.\n\nFor more details, see: [MCCompLabel documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)",
            "In ALICE Run3 simulation, a **MCLabel** (often referred to as `MCCompLabel`) is a data object used to uniquely identify and link simulated Monte Carlo (MC) particles to their originating track, event, and source kinematics files. It encapsulates three key identifiers:\n\n- **trackID**: The index of the MC track.\n- **evID**: The event number.\n- **srcID**: The source (e.g., generator) ID.\n\nThis label allows the simulation framework to correctly associate detector hits, digits, or reconstructed tracks back to their original MC particle information for analysis. The `MCCompLabel` is typically used in conjunction with the `MCTruthContainer`, a dedicated container that stores the mapping between detector-level data (like digits) and their corresponding MC labels, enabling efficient and flexible truth matching.\n\nFor more information, refer to the official documentation:  \n[ALICE O2 Simulation - MCCompLabel](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)",
