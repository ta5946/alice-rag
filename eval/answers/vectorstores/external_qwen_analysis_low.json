            "To run a simple simulation at generation level using `o2-sim`, you can generate primary particle events without performing full detector transport or hit creation. The simplest command to generate 10 default Pythia8 proton-proton (pp) events is:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp\n```\n\nThis command:\n- `-n 10`: generates 10 events.\n- `-g pythia8pp`: uses the Pythia8 generator for pp collisions.\n\nThis will produce a kinematics output file (`o2sim_Kine.root`) containing the primary and secondary particles from the generator, with information on vertices, momenta, and event-level metadata (in `o2sim_MCHeader.root`). No detector simulation or hit generation is performed\u2014this is a pure generator output, suitable for basic event generation studies.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [O2 Analysis Tutorial (Nov 2024)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf) and the [o2-sim documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf).",
            "To run a simple simulation at generation level, you can use the `o2-sim` command with a configuration file that specifies the generator settings. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Prepare a configuration file**: Use the `o2_hybrid_gen.py` script to generate a template configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) for your desired generators:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_hybrid_gen.py --gen pythia8\n   ```\n   This will create a JSON file with default parameters and a `fractions` array.\n\n2. **Run the simulation**: Use `o2-sim` with the generated configuration file:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2_ROOT}/bin/o2-sim --noGeant -j 4 --run 300000 --configKeyValues \"GeneratorHybrid.configFile=/path/to/file.json;GeneratorHybrid.randomize=true\" -g hybrid -o genevents --seed 836302859 -n 10\n   ```\n   - `--noGeant`: Skips the Geant4 simulation (if you only want generation).\n   - `-j 4`: Uses 4 threads.\n   - `--run 300000`: Sets the run number.\n   - `--configKeyValues`: Specifies the path to your config file and enables randomization.\n   - `-g hybrid`: Uses the hybrid generator.\n   - `-o genevents`: Output file name.\n   - `--seed`: Sets the random seed.\n   - `-n 10`: Generates 10 events.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [O2 Hybrid Simulation Examples](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/tree/dev/run/SimExamples/Hybrid) and the [Generator Configuration Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorconfig.md).",

The workflow will skip all steps after signal generation (no transport), set the beam-spot vertex to `kNoVertex`, and include a final `poolmerge` step that merges all `Kine.root` files from the timeframes into a single `evtpool.root` file.\n\nExample command:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM 14000 -col pp -gen pythia8 -proc cdiff -tf 2 -ns 5000 --make-evtpool -seed 546 -interactionRate 500000 -productionTag \"evtpoolcreation\" -o evtpool\n```\n\n4. Run the generated workflow using the `o2dpg_workflow_runner.py` with the `-tt pool` option to ensure the workflow reaches the `poolmerge` step:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f evtpool.json -tt pool\n```\n\n### Using an Event Pool:\n1. When feeding the event pool into a simulation workflow, use `extkinO2` as the generator.\n2. Specify the path to the `evtpool.root` file using the `GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName` configuration key.\n3. By default, events are randomised with the same seed for each timeframe, but phi randomisation is not active unless explicitly enabled.\n\nExample command:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM <emc energy [GeV]> -gen extkinO2 -tf <nTFs> --ns <nEvents> \\\n                                           -confKey \"GeneratorFromO2Kine.randomphi=true;GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName=/path/to/file/evtpool.root\" \\\n                                           -interactionRate 500000\n```\n\nFor more details, refer to the [O2DPG Workflow Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md) and the [event pool example script](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/event_pool.sh).",
            "To create and use event pools in the O2DPG framework:\n\n### Creating an Event Pool\nUse the `--make-evtpool` flag in the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script to generate an event pool. This workflow skips all steps after signal generation (no transport) and merges the generated `Kine.root` files from multiple timeframes into a single `evtpool.root` file.\n\n**Command example:**\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n  -gen <generator> \\\n  -eCM <emc energy [GeV]> \\\n  -tf <nTFs> \\\n  --ns <nEvents> \\\n  --make-evtpool \\\n  -o evtpool\n```\n\nFor instance:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n  -eCM 14000 \\\n  -col pp \\\n  -gen pythia8 \\\n  -proc cdiff \\\n  -tf 2 \\\n  -ns 5000 \\\n  --make-evtpool \\\n  -seed 546 \\\n  -interactionRate 500000 \\\n  -productionTag \"evtpoolcreation\" \\\n  -o evtpool\n```\n\nThis generates an `evtpool.json` workflow file and runs it with the `poolmerge` step to produce `evtpool.root`.\n\n### Running the Workflow\nAfter generating the workflow file, execute it using the `o2dpg_workflow_runner.py` with the `-tt pool` option to ensure it reaches the `poolmerge` step:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f evtpool.json -tt pool\n```\n\n### Using an Event Pool in a Simulation Workflow\nWhen feeding the event pool into another simulation workflow (e.g., for further processing like detector simulation), use `extkinO2` as the generator and specify the path to the `evtpool.root` file.\n\n**Command example:**\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n  -eCM <emc energy [GeV]> \\\n  -gen extkinO2 \\\n  -tf <nTFs> \\\n  --ns <nEvents> \\\n  -confKey \"GeneratorFromO2Kine.randomphi=true;GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName=/path/to/evtpool.root\"\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- By default, events from the pool are **randomised** (with the same seed per timeframe), but **phi randomisation is not active** unless explicitly enabled via `randomphi=true`.\n- Use `extkinO2` generator to read from the event pool file.\n- The workflow runner must be configured to reach the correct step when using the event pool.\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [O2DPG Event Pool Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [Event Pool Example Script](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/event_pool.sh)",

For example:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure the detector simulation**:\n   - Use `-j` to set the number of parallel workers (e.g., `-j 8` for 8 Geant3 workers).\n   - Use `--skipModules` to skip specific detector modules (e.g., `--skipModules ZDC` to exclude the ZDC).\n   - Use `-e` to select the transport engine: `TGeant3`, `Geant4`, or `FLUKA`.\n\n5. **Set magnetic field strength**:\n   Use the `--field` option to set the L3 magnetic field in kGauss (e.g., `--field 2` for 2 kGauss).\n\n6. **Run simulation with or without Geant**:\n   - Use `--noGeant` to skip the Geant transport (e.g., for fast testing).\n   - Otherwise, `o2-sim` uses Geant3 or Geant4 via the Virtual Monte Carlo API.\n\n7. **Log files**:\n   `o2-sim` generates three internal log files:\n   - `o2sim_serverlog`\n   - `o2sim_workerlog0`\n   - `o2sim_mergerlog`\n   These are useful for debugging and monitoring.\n\n8. **Example command**:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -j 8 --skipModules ZDC --field 2 -e TGeant3\n   ```\n   This generates 10 Pythia8 pp events, uses 8 workers, skips ZDC, applies a 2 kGauss field, and uses Geant3.\n\nFor detailed workflows and integration with digitization, reconstruction, and analysis, use the O2DPG or `full-system-test` repositories.\n\n> \ud83d\udd17 For more information, refer to:  \n> - [O2 Analysis Tutorial - MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf)  \n> - [ALICE Simulation Tutorial - ALICE-simulation-tutorial.pptx-1.pdf](https://github.com/ta5946/alice-rag/blob/master/data/knowledge_base/presentations/ALICE-simulation-tutorial.pptx-1.pdf)",

This ensures that only the primary particle kinematics are generated without any simulation of particle transport or detector interactions.\n\nFor example, to generate 10 default Pythia8 pp events and save only the primary kinematics:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -m CAVE --configFile only_primarykine.ini\n```\n\nThis configuration:\n- Uses `pythia8pp` to generate events.\n- Disables physics and transport via the `only_primarykine.ini` configuration file.\n- Saves the generated primary particle kinematics in `o2sim_Kine.root`.\n\nThe output file `o2sim_Kine.root` will contain the kinematics of the generated particles (vertices, momenta, etc.) without any further simulation steps.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [O2 Simulation Tutorial](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/JustPrimaryKinematics/run.sh).",
            "To perform only event generation using `o2-sim`, you can use the `--noGeant` option, which skips the transport and detector simulation (i.e., the physics interaction and hit creation steps), allowing you to generate events without simulating their passage through the detector.\n\nExample command:\n```\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp --noGeant\n```\n\nThis command generates 10 Pythia8 pp events and stops after event generation, without proceeding to transport or digitization.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [ALICE Run3 MC HowTo](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf) presentation.",
            "To perform only event generation with `o2-sim`, you can use it as a standalone event generator without proceeding to transport simulation or other downstream stages. Here's how:\n\n1. Use the `--skip-mc` or `--skip-geometry` options (if applicable) to skip geometry creation and transport simulation.\n2. Set the number of events and generator parameters via command-line flags. For example, to generate 10 default Pythia8 proton-proton (pp) events:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 10 --generators pythia8 --physics-process pp\n   ```\n   This will generate events using Pythia8 and output the kinematic information (primary particles) in the default `o2sim_Kine.root` file.\n\n3. The generated output will include:\n   - Kinematics of primary and secondary particles (if any, though transport is skipped).\n   - Event-level metadata (e.g., impact parameter) in `o2sim_MCHeader.root`.\n\n> **Note:** The `o2-sim` tool can also be used as a \"generator service\" within a DPL analysis topology to inject events on-the-fly without intermediate storage, useful for studies analyzing only primary particles.\n\nFor full details on available options, run:\n```bash\no2-sim --help\n```\n\nReferences:\n- [O2 Analysis Tutorial April 2023](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)\n- [MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf)",
            "To perform only event generation in O2 simulation (i.e., generate events without further simulation steps like transport or detector response), you can use the `o2-sim` tool with the default generator settings and disable any subsequent simulation stages.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Use the default generator** (e.g., Pythia8 for pp or PbPb collisions):\n   - For **pp collisions**: `o2-sim -g Pythia8pp`\n   - For **PbPb collisions**: `o2-sim -g Pythia8hi`\n\n2. **Generate only primary kinematics** by ensuring no transport or detector simulation is performed. The default behavior of `o2-sim` includes transport, so you must explicitly **skip transport** by using the `--skipTransport` option:\n   ```\n   o2-sim -g Pythia8pp --skipTransport -n 10\n   ```\n\n3. **Output**: This will generate 10 default Pythia8 pp events and save the primary kinematics to `o2sim_Kine.root` (by default), without any further processing.\n\n> Note: The `--skipTransport` flag prevents particle transport and detector simulation, leaving only event generation and kinematics output.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [O2 Simulation Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md) and [tutorial slides](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf).",
            "To perform only event generation in O2 simulation, you can use the `o2-sim` program with the appropriate generator configuration. Specifically, you can generate events using external generators like EPOS4 or STARlight by running the respective scripts provided in the simulation examples:\n\n- For **EPOS4**, use the `epos.sh` script to generate events, and then use `runo2sim.sh` to process them.\n- For **STARlight**, ensure the STARlight package is installed (`aliBuild build STARlight --defaults o2`), and run the example provided, noting that the number of events is limited by the `N_EVENTS` setting in the `slight.in` file.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `GeneratorHepMC` functionality with FIFOs to directly feed generator output into `o2-sim` without storing intermediate files, which is the recommended approach. This requires the generator to output HepMC data to stdout, accept a seed (`-s`), number of events (`-n`), and impact parameter (`-b`) flags.\n\nFor more details on generator usage, refer to:  \n- [EPOS4 example](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/HepMC_EPOS4/README.md)  \n- [STARlight example](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/run/SimExamples/HepMC_STARlight/README.md)  \n- [Generator documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/generators/generatorso2.md)"

The `getTracks` method of `MCKinematicsReader` supports retrieving tracks for a given MC label. Specifically, you can call `reader.getTracks(event)` to retrieve all Monte Carlo tracks for a specific event, and then iterate through the resulting `std::vector<MCTrack>` to access individual tracks by their MC label (e.g., `track.label()`).\n\nFor example:\n```cpp\n// Initialize the reader\nMCKinematicsReader reader(\"o2sim\", MCKinematicsReader::Mode::kMCKine);\n\n// Loop over events\nfor (int event = 0; event < reader.getNEvents(0); ++event) {\n  // Get all MC tracks for this event\n  std::vector<MCTrack> const& tracks = reader.getTracks(event);\n\n  // Loop over tracks and access by MC label\n  for (const auto& track : tracks) {\n    int mcLabel = track.label();  // Get the MC label\n    // Use mcLabel to identify or filter specific tracks\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor more details, refer to the [MCKinematicsReader documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md) and the [O2 Analysis Tutorial (April 2023)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo.pdf).",
