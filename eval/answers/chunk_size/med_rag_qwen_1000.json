For example, you can find the mother track of a given track with the following code:\n\n```cpp\nauto mother = o2::mcutils::MCTrackNavigator::getMother(t, tracks);\n```\n\nAnd to find the primary track from which the given track derives, you can use:\n\n```cpp\nauto primary = o2::mcutils::MCTrackNavigator::getFirstPrimary(t, tracks);\n```\n\nFor more methods and details, refer to the source code [here](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/simulation/include/SimulationDataFormat/MCUtils.h).",
            "To access `TrackReferences`, you can use the `MCKinematicsReader` and `MCTrackNavigator` utility classes. Here is an example:\n\n```cpp\nusing o2::steer;\nusing o2;\n\n// access kinematics file with simulation prefix o2sim\nMCKinematicsReader reader(\"o2sim\", MCKinematicsReader::Mode::kMCKine);\n// get all Monte Carlo tracks for this event\nstd::vector<MCTrack> const& tracks = reader.getTracks(event);\n\n// fetch mother track of each track (in the pool of all tracks)\nauto mother = o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator::getMother(t, tracks);\nif (mother) {\n    std::cout << \"This track has a mother\" << std::endl;\n}\n\n// fetch the (backward first) primary particle from which this track derives\nauto primary = o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator::getFirstPrimary(t, tracks);\n```\n\nYou can find more methods and details in the [source code](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/simulation/include/SimulationDataFormat/MCUtils.h)."
