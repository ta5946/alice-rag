        "correct_answer": "With `MCKinematicsReader` you can fetch the `TrackReference`s for a given MCLabel via:\n\n```cpp\ngsl::span<o2::TrackReference> refs = reader.getTrackRefs(sourceId, eventId, trackId);\n```",

            "Based on the provided context, there is no direct information on how to access `TrackReferences`. The context mainly discusses workflows, tracking, and MC track navigation but does not explicitly mention `TrackReferences`.\n\nTo access `TrackReferences`, you might want to look into the AliceO2 library, specifically the `SimulationDataFormat` or `MCUtils` classes, as these are often involved in handling track information. The `o2::mcutils::MCTrackNavigator` class mentioned in the context might be relevant, though it focuses on navigating and finding daughter tracks rather than `TrackReferences`.\n\nFor detailed information, you should consult the official AliceO2 documentation or source code. You can find the `MCTrackNavigator` source code [here](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/simulation/include/SimulationDataFormat/MCUtils.h).\n\nIf you have specific requirements or need more detailed guidance, please provide more context or clarify your needs.",
            "Based on the provided context, TrackReferences are not directly mentioned. However, you can browse through tracks and resolve child-parent relations using the `o2::mcutils::MCTrackNavigator` class. Specifically, you can find child tracks with the methods `getDaughter0` and `getDaughter1`.\n\nYou can refer to the source code for more methods: [source code](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/simulation/include/SimulationDataFormat/MCUtils.h).\n\nFor more specific examples and detailed information, you can also look at the documentation provided in the `mckine.md` file: [more examples](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md).",
            "To access `TrackReferences`, you can use the `o2::mcutils::MCTrackNavigator` class, which provides static functions for browsing through tracks and resolving child-parent relations. For example, to find child tracks, you can use the following code:\n\n```cpp\nauto child0 = o2::mcutils::MCTrackNavigator::getDaughter0(track, *tracks);\nauto child1 = o2::mcutils::MCTrackNavigator::getDaughter1(track, *tracks);\n```\n\nFor more methods and details, refer to the [source code](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/simulation/include/SimulationDataFormat/MCUtils.h).\n\nSource: [https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md)",
