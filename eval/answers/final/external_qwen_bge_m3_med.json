            "Using `o2-sim` is primarily focused on the simulation of particle interactions within the ALICE detector, including event generation, geometry setup, particle transport, and the creation of detector hits (energy deposits). It is designed to run efficiently using multiple worker processes and can also function as an on-the-fly event generator for analysis workflows, injecting events directly into a DPL (Data Processing Layer) topology without storing intermediate data.\n\nIn contrast, a full simulation workflow goes beyond `o2-sim` by including additional stages such as digitization (simulating the electronic response of detectors) and reconstruction (turning raw detector data into physics objects like tracks and clusters). This complete pipeline produces simulated AODs (Analysis Object Data) and requires a coordinated execution of multiple tasks, with consistent configuration across all stages. The official framework for running such full workflows in ALICE Run3 is the O2DPG repository, which provides pre-integrated, maintained scripts (e.g., `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` and `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`) to ensure reproducibility and compatibility, especially for GRID-based productions.\n\nIn summary:\n- `o2-sim` handles event generation, transport, and hit creation.\n- A full simulation workflow includes `o2-sim` but extends it with digitization, reconstruction, and AOD production via the O2DPG framework.\n\nReferences:  \n- [Getting started with o2-sim](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/gettingstarted/README.md)  \n- [O2DPG MC Workflows for Run3](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)",

It is typically used for single-step simulations or as a generator service for on-the-fly event generation in analysis pipelines.

This skips all steps after signal generation (no transport) and merges all Kine.root files from the timeframes into a single `evtpool.root` file.\n\n**Command:**\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen <generator> -eCM <emc energy [GeV]> -tf <nTFs> --ns <nEvents> --make-evtpool\n```\n\n- `-gen`: Specify the generator (e.g., `pythia8`).\n- `-eCM`: Center-of-mass energy in GeV.\n- `-tf`: Number of timeframes.\n- `--ns`: Number of events per timeframe (optional, default value applies).\n- `--make-evtpool`: Triggers creation of the event pool.\n\nAfter generating the workflow (default: `workflow.json`), run it with the `pool` task type:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt pool\n```\n\nThis produces an `evtpool.root` file in the current directory.\n\n### Using an Event Pool in Simulation\nWhen using the event pool as input for a simulation, set the generator to `extkinO2` and specify the path to the `evtpool.root` file:\n\n**Command:**\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM <emc energy [GeV]> -gen extkinO2 -tf <nTFs> --ns <nEvents> \\\n  -confKey \"GeneratorFromO2Kine.randomphi=true;GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName=/path/to/evtpool.root\" \\\n  -interactionRate 500000\n```\n\n- `GeneratorFromO2Kine.randomphi=true`: Enables phi angle randomization.\n- `GeneratorFromO2Kine.fileName`: Path to the `evtpool.root` file.\n\nAlternatively, use `o2-sim` directly:\n```bash\no2-sim -g evtpool --configKeyValues \"GeneratorEventPool.eventPoolPath=<path/to/evtpools>\"\n```\nWhere `<path/to/evtpools>` can be:\n- A directory containing `evtpool.root` files.\n- A single `evtpool.root` file.\n- A `.txt` file listing multiple `evtpool.root` files.\n\n> **Note**: The event pool file must be named `evtpool.root`; otherwise, the simulation will fail.\n\n### References:\n- [O2DPG Event Pool Workflow Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [Example Script for Event Pool Creation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/event_pool.sh)",
            "To create and use event pools in ALICE O2 simulations, follow these steps:\n\n### Creating an Event Pool\nUse the `--make-evtpool` flag in the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script to generate an event pool.

You can also provide a list of files via a `.txt` file or use a folder containing `evtpool.root` files.\n\nFor full examples, refer to:\n- [event_pool.sh script](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/examples/event_pool.sh)\n- [O2DPG workflow documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)",
            "To create and use event pools in the ALICE O2 simulation framework, follow these steps:\n\n### Creating an Event Pool\nUse the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script with the `--make-evtpool` flag to generate an event pool.

Use the following scripts:\n   - `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to generate a workflow configuration (`workflow.json`).\n   - `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` to execute the workflow.\n\n   Example workflow setup:\n   ```bash\n   # Create a workflow file\n   $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg-workflow-tools.py create my_run3_sim\n\n   # Generate the workflow (e.g., using sim + digitization + reconstruction)\n   python3 $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py --event-generator pythia8pp --n-events 10 --output-dir ./sim_output\n   ```\n\n   Then run the workflow:\n   ```bash\n   python3 $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py --workflow workflow.json\n   ```\n\n3. **Important for Run3**:\n   - Set `processRun2=false` and `processRun3=true` in relevant tasks (e.g., `bc-selection-task`, `event-selection-task`) via a JSON configuration file when running analysis or reconstruction steps.\n   - Use the `--configuration json://config.json` option to pass the configuration.\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [O2DPG MC Workflows README](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [O2DPG simulation workflow script](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py)\n- [ALICE Run3 MC HowTo (Tutorial)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo.pdf)",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Load the required environment**:\n   Ensure that both `O2DPG_ROOT` and `O2_ROOT` are set:\n   ```bash\n   [ ! \"${O2DPG_ROOT}\" ] && echo \"Error: This needs O2DPG loaded\" && exit 1\n   [ ! \"${O2_ROOT}\" ] && echo \"Error: This needs O2 loaded\" && exit 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Set up a local CCDB cache** (optional but recommended):\n   ```bash\n   export ALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE=$PWD/.ccdb\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the simulation workflow** using `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`. Example for Pythia8-driven pp collisions:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py \\\n     -eCM 13600 \\\n     -col pp \\\n     -gen external \\\n     -j 8 \\\n     -ns 10 \\\n     -tf 1 \\\n     -e TGeant4 \\\n     -mod \"--skipModules ZDC\" \\\n     -ini $O2DPG_ROOT/MC/config/PWGEM/ini/Generator_GapTriggered_LFgamma_np1_gap5.ini \\\n     -confKeyBkg \"Diamond.width[2]=6\" \\\n     -interactionRate 500000\n   ```\n\n4. **Execute the workflow** using the runner:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod --cpu-limit 32\n   ```\n\nThis will run the full simulation pipeline (event generation \u2192 Geant4 transport \u2192 digitization \u2192 reconstruction \u2192 AOD production). The `TGeant4` option specifies the use of Geant4 as the transport engine, which is the default for Run3 simulations.\n\nFor more details, refer to:\n- [O2DPG MC Workflows Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)\n- [ALICE Run3 MC HowTo Transcript](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)"

It leverages Geant4, Geant3, or FLUKA via the Virtual Monte Carlo API for particle transport and interaction simulation.\n\nKey steps for configuration:\n\n1. **Use Configurable Parameters**: The simulation relies on configurable parameters defined in the `o2sim_configuration.ini` file, which can be generated via an empty run:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE\n   ```\n   This produces a configuration file listing all parameters and their default values.\n\n2. **Modify Parameters**:\n   - Set parameters via command line using `--configKeyValues`, e.g.:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim --configKeyValues \"ParamName=Value\"\n     ```\n   - Load a custom configuration file using `--configFile`, e.g.:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim --configFile my_config.ini\n     ```\n\n3. **Adjust Detector Geometry and Materials**:\n   - For module-specific material settings, use text files in the [Passive modules data directory](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/tree/dev/Detectors/Passive/data).\n   - Modify material parameters dynamically by exporting current settings:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim-serial -n 0 --configKeyValues \"MaterialManagerParam.outputFile=o2_medium_params.json\"\n     ```\n     Edit the resulting `o2_medium_params.json`, then inject it:\n     ```bash\n     o2-sim --configKeyValues \"MaterialManagerParam.inputFile=o2_medium_params_modified.json\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Control Physics Processes**:\n   - Enable or disable specific physics processes using the global default settings defined in [SetCuts.cxx](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/Detectors/gconfig/src/SetCuts.cxx).\n\n5. **Integration with Workflows**:\n   - Use the **O2DPG repository** for physics studies on GRID or **full-system-test** for data-taking-oriented simulations to integrate all simulation stages (event generation, transport, digitization, reconstruction, QC, analysis).\n\nFor detailed documentation, refer to:\n- [Detector Simulation Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)\n- [Configurable Parameters Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/Common/SimConfig/doc/ConfigurableParam.md)\n- [Geometry Configuration](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/geometry.md)\n\nThe simulation environment can be accessed via CVMFS or built from source using the O2Sim package."

        "correct_answer": "On the level of the `o2-sim` detector simulation executable you can: (1) use `-m` to specify the exact list of modules to include, e.g. `o2-sim -m PIPE ITS TPC`; (2) use `--skipModules` to exclude modules from the full detector, e.g. `o2-sim --skipModules ZDC`; (3) instantiate the complete detector material but request hits only from certain sensitive detectors with `--readoutDetectors`, e.g. `o2-sim --skipModules ZDC --readoutDetectors ITS TPC`. On the level of the complete O2DPG MC workflows use the similar `--readoutDets` option with `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`.",
        "generated_answers": [
            "To simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline, you can use the `--configKeyValues` command-line option to configure the simulation to process only the desired detectors. For example, in the simulation script `run.sh` from the `Selective_Transport` example, the `MODULES` variable is set to specify which detectors to include:\n\n```bash\nMODULES=\"PIPE ITS TPC\"\n```\n\nThis tells the simulation to only process the PIPE, ITS, and TPC detectors. You can adjust this list to include only the detectors you are interested in.\n\nAdditionally, you can further control the simulation by modifying configuration parameters in a configuration file (e.g., `sim.ini`) or via command-line options. For instance, you can use:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 100 --configKeyValues \"DetectorList=ITS,TPC\" -m CAVE\n```\n\nThis command runs 100 events and restricts the simulation to the ITS and TPC detectors.\n\nFor more details on configurable parameters, refer to the [ALICE O2 Simulation Configuration Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/Common/SimConfig/doc/ConfigurableParam.md) and the [Detector Simulation documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md).",
            "To simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline, you can use configurable parameters to enable or disable specific detectors during the simulation. The `o2-sim` tool supports this through command-line options such as `--configKeyValues`, where you can set parameters that control which detectors are active.\n\nFor example, you can specify detector-specific parameters in the configuration, such as:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 --configKeyValues \"DetectorList=ITS,TPC\"\n```\n\nThis command will simulate only the ITS and TPC detectors. The list of available detectors and their corresponding parameters can be found in the `o2sim_configuration.ini` file, which is generated by running:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE\n```\n\nThis generates a default configuration file that lists all configurable parameters, including those related to detector activation (e.g., `DetectorList`, `EnableDetector*`).\n\nFor more details, refer to the official documentation:  \n- [Configurable Parameters in ALICE O2 Simulation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/Common/SimConfig/doc/ConfigurableParam.md)  \n- [o2-sim Configuration Guide](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/README.md)",
            "To simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline, use the `--readoutDetectors` command-line option in `o2-sim`. This option allows you to specify a list of detectors that will produce hits during the simulation, effectively skipping hit creation for all other detectors.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 --readoutDetectors TPC,ITS\n```\nThis command will simulate only the TPC and ITS detectors.\n\nAlternatively, you can use `--skipReadoutDetectors` to explicitly exclude certain detectors from the simulation.\n\nThese options are documented in the [o2-sim options](https://github.com/ta5946/alice-rag/blob/master/data/knowledge_base/presentations/MC_Tutorials.pdf) section of the ALICE MC tutorial materials.\n\nReference:  \n- [MC_Tutorials.pdf](https://github.com/ta5946/alice-rag/blob/master/data/knowledge_base/presentations/MC_Tutorials.pdf)",
            "To simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline, you can use the `o2-sim-digitizer-workflow` executable with detector-specific configuration. This workflow allows you to selectively run digitization for desired detectors by configuring the workflow to include only the relevant detector digitizer processors and IO processors.\n\nThe digitization process is modular and detector-specific, with each detector having its own digitizer processor and IO processor. You can control which detectors are simulated by specifying the appropriate detector names in the workflow configuration file (typically in JSON format). The workflow is managed via the O2DPG repository or the `full-system-test` framework, which provide predefined configurations for full or partial simulations.\n\nFor example, you can create a custom workflow that includes only the ITS, TPC, and TRD digitizers, excluding others. This is achieved by modifying the workflow definition in the JSON configuration to include only the desired detectors.\n\nFor detailed guidance, refer to:\n- [Detector Simulation Documentation (ALICE O2)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)\n- [O2DPG MC Workflows](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo.pdf)",
            "To simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline, you can use configurable parameters to enable or disable specific detectors during the simulation process.

For example:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim --configKeyValues \"DetectorList=ITS,TPC\"\n   ```\n   This will simulate only the ITS and TPC detectors.\n\n2. The list of available detectors and their configuration options can be found in the `o2sim_configuration.ini` file, which is generated by running:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE\n   ```\n   This file lists all configurable parameters, including detector-specific settings.\n\n3. For more advanced control, you can modify or create custom configuration files (e.g., `config.ini`) and pass them using:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim --configFile config.ini\n   ```\n\n4. The detector simulation is managed in the O2DPG workflow system, which allows full control over the simulation chain. You can define workflows that include only specific detectors using the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script.\n\nFor detailed information on detector-specific parameters, refer to the [ALICE O2 Simulation Documentation - Detector Simulation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md) and the [O2DPG MC Workflows documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/README.md)."

            "MCTruth in the ALICE O2 framework is managed through the `MCTruthContainer`, a dedicated data structure that associates reconstructed objects (like tracks or collisions) with their corresponding Monte Carlo (MC) truth information. This container is written as a separate branch in the output file, alongside other data branches such as digits, enabling efficient access to MC truth without increasing memory overhead.\n\nTo link reconstructed data with MC truth, the framework uses index columns that are joined with the relevant tables. For example:\n- To access MC truth for a reconstructed track, the `soa::Join<aod::Tracks, aod::McTrackLabels>` is used, allowing retrieval of the associated `McParticle` via the `track.mcParticle()` method.\n- For collisions, `soa::Join<aod::Collisions, aod::McCollisionLabels>` enables access to the `McCollision` via `collision.mcCollision()`.\n\nThe MC truth information includes details such as particle kinematics (e.g., position, momentum), and is stored using the `MCCompLabel` class, which encapsulates identifiers for track, event, and source kinematics. This system enables detailed studies such as reconstruction efficiency, particle identification, and detector response validation.\n\nFor further details, refer to:\n- [DetectorSimulation.md](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md)\n- [workingWithMCdata.md](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/analysis-framework/blob/master/docs/tutorials/workingWithMCdata.md)",
