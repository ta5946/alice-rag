        "correct_answer": "ALICE\u2019s full MC workflow is provided in the O2DPG repository.

        "generated_answer": "To run the production MC workflow for ALICE using O2DPG, you can use the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script. Here's how you can proceed:\n\n1. Make sure that O2DPG and O2 are loaded in your environment. You can check this with:\n   ```bash\n   [ ! \"${O2DPG_ROOT}\" ] && echo \"Error: This needs O2DPG loaded\" && exit 1\n   [ ! \"${O2_ROOT}\" ] && echo \"Error: This needs O2 loaded\" && exit 1\n   ```\n\n2. Run the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script to generate a workflow description file. For example, to simulate pp PYTHIA jets with 2 events, triggered on high pT decay photons on all barrel calorimeters acceptance, at eCMS 13 TeV, you can use the command:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -e TGeant3 -ns 2 -j 8 -tf 1 -mod \"--skipModules ZDC\" -col pp -eCM 13000 \\\n       -proc \"jets\" -ptHatBin 3 \\\n       -trigger \"external\" -ini \"\\$O2DPG_ROOT/MC/config/PWGGAJE/ini/trigger_decay_gamma_allcalo_TrigPt3_5.ini\"\n   ```\n   This command will create a `workflow.json` file that describes the graph of individual tasks to run.\n\n3. Once the `workflow.json` file is generated, you can execute the tasks defined in it using the `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` script:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json\n   ```\n\nFor more detailed instructions and options, you can refer to the help provided by the scripts:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py --help\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py --help\n```\n\nYou may also need a valid GRID token to access CCDB objects/alien.

        "question": "How can I simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline?",
        "correct_answer": "With `o2-sim` you can control modules and readout at two levels:\n\n1. **Module-level inclusion/exclusion**\n   - `-m MODULE1 MODULE2 \u2026` to include only specified modules (including passive material), e.g.:  \n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -m PIPE ITS TPC\n     ```\n   - `--skipModules MODULE` to exclude specific modules, e.g.:  \n     ```bash\n     o2-sim --skipModules ZDC\n     ```\n\n2. **Readout-level filtering**\n   - `--readoutDetectors DET1 DET2 \u2026` instantiates the full geometry (minus any skipped modules) but only writes hits for the listed sensitive detectors, e.g.:  \n     ```bash\n     o2-sim --skipModules ZDC --readoutDetectors ITS TPC\n     ```\n\nIn the O2DPG MC workflows you can use the analogous `--readoutDets` option with `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to configure which detectors produce output in the integrated pipeline.",
        "generated_answer": "To simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline, you can use the `--skipModules` option when running the `o2-sim` executable. For example, if you want to skip the ZDC and PHOS detectors, you can run:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -e TGeant4 -j 2 --skipModules ZDC,PHOS\n```\n\nThis command will launch a simulation for 10 pythia8 events on the whole ALICE detector except for the ZDC and PHOS detectors, using Geant4 on 2 parallel worker processes.\n\nFor more detailed control and configuration options, you can refer to the [transport section](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/README.md) in the O2 simulation documentation.",

        "correct_answer": "In ALICE Run 3, a Monte Carlo label (MCLabel) is the triple `(source_id, event_id, track_id)` that uniquely identifies an MCTrack across one or more kinematics files. It is implemented via the C++ class `o2::MCCompLabel`.",
        "generated_answer": "A MClabel in ALICE run3 simulation is a label that encapsulates the identifiers of track, event, and source kinematics files. This information is enough to look up and load the precise Monte Carlo track. MClabels are used to associate digits to an arbitrary number of labels via filling a separate and dedicated container called `MCTruthContainer`. This container is written as a separate branch to the output file, next to the branch for digits. For more details on how to access MC kinematics using MClabels, you can refer to the `MCKinematicsReader` class which needs the digitization context file generated during digitization and can return the tracks associated with a Monte Carlo label.\n\nSource: [Accessing Monte Carlo kinematics](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/doc/DetectorSimulation.md#accessing-monte-carlo-kinematics)",

        "generated_answer": "MC labels in ALICE simulation are stored in a container of type `o2::dataformats::MCTruthContainer<o2::dataformats::MCCompLabel>` for each detector.

        "question": "How does MCTruth work?",
        "correct_answer": "MCTruth uses MCLabels to associate downstream products (digits, clusters, reconstructed tracks) with their originating MCTrack(s). By storing these labels, one can perform closure tests, efficiency studies, and detailed physics analyses using the true generator- and simulation-level information.",
        "generated_answer": "MCTruth, in the context of the O2 simulation, works by creating a kinematics output from the transport simulation. This output is stored in a special `MCTrack` class, which is similar to ROOT's `TParticles` class but more memory and disk efficient. The `MCTrack` class contains information about creation vertices, momenta, and other properties of primary and secondary particles, as well as their mother-daughter relationships. This information is stored in a TTree format, making it easy to browse and analyze using ROOT tools.\n\nFor detailed stepping information, you can run the simulation with the `MCSTEPLOG_TTREE` environment variable set to 1 and using the `libMCStepLoggerInterceptSteps.so` library. This will produce a file containing detailed step-by-step information about the simulation, which can be analyzed with a special analysis framework.\n\nYou can find more information about this in the [MCStepLogger documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/VMCStepLogger/blob/master/README.md).\n\nSource: [O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md)",

        "generated_answer": "To access MC tracks given a MC label, you can use the `MCKinematicsReader` class.
