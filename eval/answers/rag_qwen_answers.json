        "generated_answer": "To run the Run3 detector simulation, you need to use the `o2-sim` executable. By default, it runs a simulation with the complete Run3 geometry. You can exclude certain modules from the geometry using the `--skipModules <mod1> [<mod2> [...]]` option, or include only certain modules using `-m|--modules <mod1> [<mod2> [...]]`. Note that `--skipModules` takes precedence over `-m`.\n\nThe software environment required for running the ALICE detector simulations includes the O2Sim package, which you can build or take from CVMFS in precompiled form.\n\nFor more detailed usage information, you can refer to the documentation for `o2-sim` and `o2-sim-digitizer-workflow` executables.\n\n[Source 1: Getting started documentation for `o2-sim` executable](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/gettingstarted/README.md)\n\n[Source 2: Transport simulation documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/README.md)",

The `-g hybrid` flag indicates the use of the Hybrid generator, and `-o genevents` specifies the output format.

        "question": "How can I simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline?",
        "correct_answer": "With `o2-sim` you can control modules and readout at two levels:\n\n1. **Module-level inclusion/exclusion**\n   - `-m MODULE1 MODULE2 \u2026` to include only specified modules (including passive material), e.g.:  \n     ```bash\n     o2-sim -m PIPE ITS TPC\n     ```\n   - `--skipModules MODULE` to exclude specific modules, e.g.:  \n     ```bash\n     o2-sim --skipModules ZDC\n     ```\n\n2. **Readout-level filtering**\n   - `--readoutDetectors DET1 DET2 \u2026` instantiates the full geometry (minus any skipped modules) but only writes hits for the listed sensitive detectors, e.g.:  \n     ```bash\n     o2-sim --skipModules ZDC --readoutDetectors ITS TPC\n     ```\n\nIn the O2DPG MC workflows you can use the analogous `--readoutDets` option with `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to configure which detectors produce output in the integrated pipeline.",
        "generated_answer": "To simulate only specific detectors in the ALICE MC pipeline, you can use the `--skipModules` option when running the simulation. For example, to skip the ZDC and PHOS detectors, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -e TGeant4 -j 2 --skipModules ZDC,PHS\n```\n\nThis command will launch a simulation for 10 Pythia8 events on the entire ALICE detector except for ZDC and PHOS, using Geant4 on 2 parallel worker processes.\n\nFor more details on available command-line arguments, you can refer to the [transport section](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/transport/README.md).",
