The `--skipModules` flag takes precedence over `-m`.\n\n- **Event Generation**: Use the `-g` flag followed by the generator name to specify the event generator. For ALICE Run3, Pythia8 is the default generator. Additional parameters can be set using `--configKeyValues`.\n\n- **Number of Events**: Use the `-n` or `--nevents` flag to set the number of events to be generated.\n\n- **XML File Input**: Use the `-i` or `--input` flag to specify an XML file for JETSCAPE input.\n\n- **Number of Jobs**: Use the `-j` or `--jobs` flag to set the number of worker processes.\n\nFor detailed setup and configuration, you can refer to the `o2sim_configuration.ini` file or use specific scripts like `runo2sim.sh`. You can also specify custom parameters through the `--configKeyValues` flag.\n\nFor more advanced setup, especially for PWG-specific generation, you might need to reference specific generators and configurations, such as the PWGDQ cocktail generator, and use ROOT macro files as necessary.\n\nFor a comprehensive guide, you can refer to the ALICE Analysis Tutorial and the O2DPG \u2013 the official integrated MC production pipeline documentation.",

By storing these labels, one can perform closure tests, efficiency studies, and detailed physics analyses using the true generator- and simulation-level information.",
        "generated_answers": [
            "MCTruth in O2 refers to the process of creating and managing Monte Carlo tracks, which contain information about the primary and secondary particles generated in the simulation. Each event in the simulation corresponds to a vector of MCTrack objects stored in a TTree. The MCTrack class is a lightweight version of TParticle and includes details such as creation vertices, momenta, and other attributes of both primary (generated) and secondary (transported) particles. This data provides information on the physics creation process, including particle lineage (mother-daughter relationships). By default, kinematics data is pruned to include only relevant particles, and event-level meta-information about each generated event is available in a separate file named `o2sim_MCHeader.root`.",
            "MCTruth works by populating a separate and dedicated container called `MCTruthContainer`, which is written as a distinct branch in the output file alongside the branch for digits. This approach ensures that digits remain closely aligned with raw data while allowing for an unlimited number of labels with minimal memory overhead.",
            "MCTruth in O2 simulation, as indicated in the context, involves the creation and tracking of particles from their generation through their interactions with the detector material and their final states. The MCTruth information is stored using the `o2::MCTrack` class, which provides details such as creation vertices, momenta, and other attributes of primary and secondary particles. This information is useful for physics analysis and is stored in a TTree with one entry of `vector<MCTracks>` per event. The MCTruth data can be pruned to include only relevant particles and additional event-level metadata is also available. For Pythia8 events, this process can be seen in the `run.sh` and `run_Pythia8.sh` scripts provided in the context, where Pythia8 is used to generate events, and these events are processed to produce MCTruth information.",
            "MCTruth, as part of the o2-sim program, works by generating the primary particle collisions and simulating the interactions of these particles with the detector material. It then tracks the movement of particles within the detector setup until they either exit or stop. This process results in the formation of hits, which are energy depositions used as input for the detector digitizers to generate the actual sensor output. MCTruth does not involve the storage of events during the simulation phase but rather feeds generated events directly into the DPL analysis framework for rapid studies focusing on primary particles.",
            "MCTruth, which is essentially the simulation of particle interactions and their transport through the detector, works by generating events using particle generators like Pythia8. These events include primary particles that are created according to specified initial conditions and secondary particles that result from interactions within the detector material. The simulation tracks these particles as they move through the detector, interacting with the material and producing hits, which are energy depositions that form the basis of the detector's response. The simulation outputs this data in a format that can be used for further analysis, including information on particle creation vertices, momenta, and other attributes, which is stored in a class called `o2::MCTrack`, a lighter version of TParticle. This data is organized into a TTree with entries for each event, and kinematics data is typically pruned to include only relevant particles.
