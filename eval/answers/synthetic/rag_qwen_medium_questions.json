            "To run MC in ALICE3, you would use the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script. This script sets up a Monte Carlo workflow of dependent tasks. You can call this script with various parameters to configure the simulation, such as the collision system, event generator, number of timeframes, number of events per timeframe, interaction rate, and run number. For example:\n\n```bash\no2dpg_sim_workflow.py --collision-system pp --energy 14000 --n-timesteps 5 --events-per-timestep 2000 --event-generator pythia8\n```\n\nAfter setting up the workflow, you can use `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` to execute the tasks defined in the workflow file.",
            "The main scripts provided in O2DPG for running MC in ALICE3 are `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` and `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`. To run MC using `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py`, you would use it to configure the MC workflow as a function of important user parameters. For example, you can specify the number of events, event generator, interaction rate, and other relevant parameters. You can find more details on how to use these scripts in the documentation available at the [O2DPG repository](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG).",
            "The purpose of the `external` generator in the simulation configuration file `sim.ini` is to add custom information to the event header during the event generation process. This external generator is specified in the command line with the `-g external` option, which instructs the simulation to use this generator to modify the standard event data, potentially enriching it with additional details or analyses before the events are processed by the simulation modules.",

To execute the tasks defined in the workflow file, you would use the `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` script. Both of these scripts are part of the O2DPG repository, which provides the authoritative setup for official MC productions for ALICE-Run3. For more information, you can refer to the [O2DPG repository](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG) and the [README.md](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/README.md) in the `MC/bin` directory.",

According to the provided context, this script facilitates submitting jobs to a grid for parallel processing. However, there is no specific mention of a script named `grid_submit.sh` for running MC in ALICE3. The context does not provide a script to directly run MC in ALICE3, but it does describe how `o2-sim` is used for scalable multi-core simulation with sub-event parallelism.\n\nFor running MC simulations in ALICE3, you would typically use the `o2-sim` tool with appropriate parameters and configurations. Examples of using `o2-sim` are provided in the context, such as generating events with different event generators and detector simulations."
