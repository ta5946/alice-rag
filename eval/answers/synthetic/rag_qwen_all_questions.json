Additionally, this configuration is activated by setting the `GeneratorExternal.fileName` to the path of the macro file defining the generator, and the `GeneratorExternal.funcName` to the function that runs the generator. In this case, the macro file is `GeneratorHF.macro`, and the function is `GeneratorHF()`.

To configure it, you can use a Python tool provided for convenience to create a configuration file based on a few input parameters. Alternatively, you can manually configure Pythia8 using a specific file structure. Make sure to compile and link the modified external generator properly and adjust the simulation command to use the updated generator. For more detailed steps on how to implement custom generators, refer to the provided documentation.",

Additionally, you can specify the generator configuration file and function using the `--configKeyValues` setting, such as `GeneratorExternal.fileName=GeneratorHF.macro` and `GeneratorExternal.funcName=\"GeneratorHF()\"`.
