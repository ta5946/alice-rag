For example:\n   ```bash\n   o2-sim -g pythia8 --noGeant -n 100 -j 4 --configFile my_config.ini\n   ```\n\nThis approach allows you to perform a simple simulation at the generation level without the need for setting up a full workflow, making it ideal for testing or initial simulations."

This generates a JSON workflow that skips the AOD creation and, instead, moves to a *poolmerge* step that merges the output from the various timeframes generated into a single `evtpool.root` file.\nAn easy example is:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen pythia8pp -eCM 13000 -tf 8 -ns 100 --make-evtpool -interactionRate 500000 -seed 123\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt pool\n```\nThe generated file can later be used via the `evtpool` generator that allows multiple events reading customisations (round-robin, randomisation etc.) and is compatible with either local paths or alien ones, making it extremely versatile. A configuration example using the hybrid generator is:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\": \"evtpool\",\n  \"config\": {\n    \"eventPoolPath\": \"alien:///alice/sim/2025/EP25f1/2\",\n    \"skipNonTrackable\": true,\n    \"roundRobin\": false,\n    \"randomize\": true,\n    \"rngseed\": 0,\n    \"randomphi\": false\n  }\n}\n```",

For example, to download a TPC alignment object:\n     ```bash\n     ${O2_ROOT}/bin/o2-ccdb-downloadccdbfile --host http://alice-ccdb.cern.ch -p TPC/Calib/Align --timestamp <timestamp> -d ${ALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE}\n     ```\n\n3. **Run the Simulation**:\n   - The cached objects will be used during the simulation, avoiding the need to download them each time.\n\n**Note**: Ensure the timestamp of your cached objects matches your simulation requirements, as no automatic check is performed.",
            "Yes, you can provide CCDB objects for simulations instead of downloading them each time. Here's how:\n\n1. **Set up a cache directory**: By default, the cache is in `${CWD}/ccdb`, but you can change it using:\n   ```bash\n   export ALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE=/path/to/snapshot_cache\n   ```\n   Make sure to use an absolute path.\n\n2. **Download custom objects**: Use the following command to download specific CCDB objects and store them in your cache directory:\n   ```bash\n   ${O2_ROOT}/bin/o2-ccdb-downloadccdbfile --host http://alice-ccdb.cern.ch -p <path> --timestamp <timestamp> -d ${ALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE}\n   ```\n   Replace `<path>` with the CCDB object path (e.g., `ITS/Calib/Align`) and `<timestamp>` with the desired timestamp.\n\n3. **Run simulations with cached objects**: Once the objects are cached, subsequent simulation runs will use the cached versions instead of downloading them again.\n\nFor example, to download TPC alignment objects:\n```bash\n${O2_ROOT}/bin/o2-ccdb-downloadccdbfile --host http://alice-ccdb.cern.ch -p TPC/Calib/Align --timestamp <timestamp> -d ${ALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE}\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to reuse CCDB objects across multiple simulations without re-downloading them each time.\n\n[Source](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/o2dpgworkflow/ccdb.md)"

        "correct_answer": "Use the O2DPG-provided workflows which integrate the AliceO2 executables into end-to-end MC pipelines. Two supported ways are:\n\n1) Build and run a workflow explicitly with the two O2DPG Python scripts:\n\n- Create the workflow description (workflow.json) with `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` and then execute it with `o2dpg_workflow_runner.py`.\n\nExample:\n`\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM 14000  -col pp -gen pythia8 -tf 1 -ns 2000 --interactionRate 500000 -run 302000\n\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod\n`\nThis configures a complete simulation for 1 timeframe of pp collisions and runs up to the `aod` stage.\n\n2) (Typical user) Use the provided anchor script `anchorMC.sh`, which manages setup and execution for MC that matches real data-taking conditions. You set a few obligatory environment variables (data-taking period, reconstruction pass, plus generator options) and call the script. Detailed docs are available in the O2DPG documentation (anchored workflow).",

            "To run the production Monte Carlo (MC) workflow for ALICE, follow these steps using the provided resources:\n\n1. **Generate the Workflow Configuration**:\n   Use the script `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to create a `workflow.json` file.

Example command:\n\n   ```bash\n   ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM 14000 -col pp -gen pythia8 -proc cdiff -tf 5 -ns 2000 -interactionRate 500000 -run 302000\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Up Environment**:\n   Ensure you have a valid alien token for CCDB access and that your system meets the resource requirements (8 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM).\n\n3. **Execute the Workflow**:\n   Run the workflow using `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py`, which executes the tasks defined in `workflow.json`.\n\nFor detailed instructions and additional parameters, refer to the documentation:\n\n- [O2DPG Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/README.md)\n- [Workflow Tools](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/README.md)\n\nThese links provide comprehensive guidance on setting up and running the MC workflows, including options for adding tasks and managing workflow files.",

ConfigurableParams are two-level key-value strings `MainKey.SubKey=Value` passed via the `--configKeyValues` option; the main key addresses a broader category and the sub-key a specific modifiable variable. Example configurable parameter: `G4Params.configMacroFile` to set a Geant4 input file. Full example: `o2-sim -e TGeant4 --configKeyValues=\"G4Params.configMacroFile=myG4config.in\"`.
