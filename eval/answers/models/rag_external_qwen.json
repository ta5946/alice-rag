            "To run a simple simulation at the generation level using O2 simulation, you can generate events using the `o2-sim` command with minimal configuration. For example, to generate 10 default Pythia8 proton-proton (pp) events without performing full detector simulation, use:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -m CAVE --skip-mc\n```\n\n- `-n 10`: Generates 10 events.\n- `-m CAVE`: Uses the CAVE geometry (a minimal setup for simulation).\n- `--skip-mc`: Skips the full Monte Carlo transport and digitization, producing only generator-level output.\n\nThis will output the primary particle kinematics in `o2sim_Kine.root` and event metadata in `o2sim_MCHeader.root`, which are useful for physics analysis. The kinematics data includes creation vertices, momenta, particle types, and mother-daughter relations.\n\nFor more details on available options, run:\n```bash\no2-sim --help\n```\n\nThis approach is suitable for testing generator behavior or analyzing event kinematics without full detector simulation.\n\nSource: [O2 Analysis Tutorial April 2023](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_April2023/ALICE-Run3-MC-HowTo_Transcript.md), [O2 Simulation Documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/README.md)",
            "To run a simple simulation at the generation level using O2, you can generate events directly from the Monte Carlo (MC) generator without performing any transport or detector simulation. This is commonly referred to as a \"pure generator output.\"\n\nThe simplest way to do this is by using the `o2-sim` command with the `-n` flag to specify the number of events and the `-g` flag to select the generator type. For a default Pythia8 proton-proton (pp) collision simulation with 10 events, you would run:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Generates 10 default Pythia8 pp events.\n- Does not simulate transport or detector response (i.e., no hits, digits, or reconstruction).\n- Outputs the kinematic information (primary and secondary particles) to a file named `o2sim_Kine.root`.\n- Stores event-level metadata (e.g., impact parameter for PbPb collisions) in `o2sim_MCHeader.root`.\n\nFor more details on the available options, you can use:\n```bash\no2-sim --help\n```\n\nThis will list all main options and default generation parameters.\n\n> **Note**: The `o2sim_configuration.ini` file produced by a dry run (`o2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE`) contains the full list of configurable parameters and their default values, which can be used to customize the simulation.\n\n**Sources**:\n- [O2 Simulation Tutorial (Nov 2024)](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/additional_resources/talks/O2_AnalysisTutorial_Nov2024/MCTutorial4Giacalone.pdf)\n- [O2DPG Generator Script](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/o2_hybrid_gen.py)",
            "To run a simple simulation at the generation level in O2, you can use the `o2-sim` executable with the `-g` flag to specify the generator and the `-n` flag to set the number of events. For example:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g external --configKeyValues 'GeneratorExternal.fileName=myGen.C;GeneratorExternal.funcName=\"gen(5020)\"'\n```\n\nThis command runs a simulation with 10 events using a custom generator defined in `myGen.C`. The generator is loaded via the `external` option, and the function name is specified using `configKeyValues`.\n\nAlternatively, if you are using a predefined generator like EPOS4 or JETSCAPE, you can use the provided scripts such as `runo2sim.sh` or `epos.sh`, which handle the generation and simulation workflow. For instance:\n\n```bash\n./runo2sim.sh -n 10 -i example.optns\n```\n\nThis runs the simulation with 10 events using the configuration from `example.optns`.\n\nFor more advanced setups, you can use the `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` script with a JSON workflow file generated by `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to control the simulation and generation process.\n\nSee [O2DPG documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py) and [HepMC examples](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/tree/dev/run/SimExamples/HepMC) for further details.",

Initialize the `MCKinematicsReader` with the appropriate file (e.g., `o2sim_MCKinematics.root` or similar):\n   ```cpp\n   o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader reader(\"o2sim\", o2::steer::MCKinematicsReader::Mode::kMCKine);\n   ```\n\n2. Use the `getTracks()` method with the MC label to retrieve the corresponding track(s). The `getTracks()` method can accept a label directly:\n   ```cpp\n   std::vector<o2::MCTrack> const& tracks = reader.getTracks(label);\n   ```\n\n   This returns a vector of `o2::MCTrack` objects associated with the given MC label.\n\n3. You can then iterate over the returned tracks to analyze their properties (e.g., PDG code, vertex, momentum, mother/daughter relations).\n\nNote: The `MCKinematicsReader` must be initialized with the correct context file (e.g., `collisioncontext.root`) if using a label-based lookup during digitization or analysis.\n\nFor navigation within the MC track tree (e.g., finding mothers, daughters, or primary particles), use the `MCTrackNavigator` utility class:\n```cpp\nauto mother = o2::mcutils::MCTrackNavigator::getMother(track, tracks);\nauto primary = o2::mcutils::MCTrackNavigator::getFirstPrimary(track, tracks);\n```\n\nRelevant documentation:\n- [MCKinematicsReader documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md)\n- [MCTrackNavigator source code](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/simulation/include/SimulationDataFormat/MCUtils.h)",
