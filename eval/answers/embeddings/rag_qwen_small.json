For instance:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -g pythia8 --configFile <path/to/config.ini>\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\no2-sim -g pythia8 --configKeyValues \"Stack.pruneKine=false\"\n```\n\nThese methods allow you to fine-tune the simulation according to your needs.",

You can generate a template configuration file for Pythia8 using the O2DPG script:\n\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_hybrid_gen.py --gen pythia8\n```\n\nThis will create a configuration file with default settings.

These tracks are based on the kinematics output from the simulation, and they are stored in a TTree structure using the `o2::MCTrack` class. The `MCTrack` class is a lightweight version of `TParticle` and is used to store information about primary and secondary particles created in the simulation.\n\nThe MCTruth functionality allows for analyzing these tracks by providing methods to access various properties such as PDG properties, kinematics, production vertices, and child-parent relations. This is useful for physics analysis as it provides detailed information on the physics creation process and the provenance of particles.\n\nFor example, the MCTruth functionality can be accessed through an `MCKinematicsReader`, which can retrieve tracks for a given MC label. The reader can be used to loop over all events in a file and analyze the tracks, such as checking if a track has hits or if it has a primary particle as its mother.\n\nHere are some relevant links for further information:\n- [o2::MCTrack class documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/simulation/include/SimulationDataFormat/MCTrack.h)\n- [MCKinematicsReader documentation](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/simulation/blob/main/docs/transport/mckine.md)",

These particles are based on the o2::MCTrack class, a lightweight version of TParticle. For each event, there is a vector of MCTracks stored in a TTree. By default, only relevant particles are kept, and event-level meta-information is available in a separate file `o2sim_MCHeader.root`. This information includes details such as the impact parameter of PbPb collisions. MCTruth provides a structured way to access and analyze the physics creation process and the provenance (mother-daughter relationships) of particles.",

This is done using a separate container called `MCTruthContainer` which stores `MCCompLabel` objects. Each digit has a corresponding entry in this container where the labels can be accessed. The `MCCompLabel` encapsulates identifiers for tracks, events, and source kinematics files. This setup allows for an arbitrary number of labels per digit, facilitating detailed simulation and analysis. For more information, you can refer to the provided contexts, particularly the documentation on the `MCTruthContainer` and `MCCompLabel`.",
            "MCTruth, or the Monte Carlo truth, works by first generating particles using a particle physics event generator like Pythia8.

The MCTrack class, which is a lightweight version of TParticle, is used to store information about these particles, including their creation vertices, momenta, and other properties.\n\nFor each event, the simulation stores this information in a TTree format, with one entry of a vector of MCTracks. This data is pruned by default, keeping only relevant particles. Additionally, event-level meta-information about each generated event is stored in a separate file (o2sim_MCHeader.root). Tools like MCKinematicsReader and MCTrackNavigator make it easier to access and analyze this data, allowing users to retrieve tracks for a given event or navigate through the mother-daughter relationships of the tracks."
