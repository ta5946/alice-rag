Use the dedicated DPL tool `o2-sim-dpl-eventgen` to generate events on\u2011the\u2011fly without writing hits.\n3.

This will prevent the simulation from running the QC checks and will only produce the output of the event-generation stage.",
            "To only obtain the output of the event-generation stage, you can run the o2-sim command with the `-g` option to specify the generator and without running the full transport simulation.

The `-o generator_output` option specifies the prefix for the output files, and `--configFile sim.ini` specifies the configuration file to use. The `> generator_log 2>&1` part redirects both standard output and standard error to a log file named `generator_log`.",

You should use the `-g` option to specify the generator and the `--configFile` option to point to a configuration file that disables physics and sets tight geometry cuts to prevent Geant4 from performing any work.\n\nHere is a simplified command you can use:\n\n```bash\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp -m CAVE --configFile only_primarykine.ini\n```\n\nThis command generates 10 events using the Pythia8pp generator and stores only the kinematic information without performing any transport or physics simulation.",
