These tracks represent primary and secondary particles, including their creation vertices, momenta, and other relevant properties. The `MCKinematicsReader` class allows for easy reading and retrieval of tracks for a given event or Monte Carlo label, while `MCTrackNavigator` enables navigation through the mother-daughter tree of MC tracks and querying of physics properties. This setup is crucial for on-the-fly analysis, where events are generated and analyzed without intermediate storage, making it particularly useful for fast-simulation studies and primary-only analysis tasks.",

It involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Event Generation**: Primary particle collisions are generated according to physics models.\n2. **Transport Simulation**: Particles are tracked as they interact with the detector material, creating hits along their paths.\n3. **Digitization**: Hits are converted into signals that simulate the detector output.\n\nThese processes are encapsulated in classes like `MCKinematicsReader` and `MCTrackNavigator` which make it easier for users to access and analyze the Monte Carlo (MC) kinematics data. For example, `MCKinematicsReader` allows reading and retrieving tracks for a given event or Monte Carlo label, while `MCTrackNavigator` helps navigate through the mother-daughter tree of MC tracks and query physics properties.",

Finally, it creates hits, which are energy deposits that serve as a pre-stage for the actual sensor output produced by the detector digitizers.
