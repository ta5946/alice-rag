            "To run the production MC workflow for ALICE, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Workflow Description**:\n   - Use the script `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` to configure and create a valid description of the Monte Carlo job. This script needs parameters such as the generator and beam energy. For example:\n     ```bash\n     ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen <generator> -eCM <emc energy [GeV]>\n     ```\n     or\n     ```bash\n     ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen <generator> -eA <energy of first incoming beam [GeV]> -eB <energy of second incoming beam [GEV]>\n     ```\n\n2. **Run the Workflow**:\n   - After creating the workflow description, use the script `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` to execute the tasks defined in the workflow file:\n     ```bash\n     ${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py workflow.json\n     ```\n\nMake sure you have at least 16 GB of RAM and an 8-core machine.

            "To configure ALICE Run3 simulation, you can use configurable parameters. These parameters can be set via configuration files or from the command line using options like `--configFile` and `--configKeyValues`. The complete list of parameters and their default values can be inspected in the file `o2sim_configuration.ini`, produced by running `o2-sim -n 0 -m CAVE`.\n\nTo modify parameters on the fly, you can first extract the current parameter configuration using:\n```bash\no2-sim-serial -n0 --configKeyValues \"MaterialManagerParam.outputFile=o2_medium_params.json\"\n```\nThis will generate `o2_medium_params.json`. You can then modify this file and inject the new parameter configuration with:\n```bash\no2-sim --configKeyValues \"MaterialManagerParam.inputFile=o2_medium_params_modified.json\" [<further_arguments>]\n```\n\nFor specific modules, you can set parameters from text files that are parsed at runtime, such as those found in the Passive modules directory:\n```\nhttps://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/tree/dev/Detectors/Passive/data\n```\n\nYou can also switch on or off some physics processes using default settings located in:\n```\nhttps://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/Detectors/gconfig/src/SetCuts.cxx\n```\n\nFor event generators, Pythia8 is the default generator for ALICE Run3. You can specify it with `o2-sim -g pythia8`. Additional parameters might be needed and can be set via `--configKeyValues`.\n\nFor more detailed workflows, consider using the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` and `o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py` scripts provided in the O2DPG repository. Relevant environment variables can be set for these runs, such as `NWORKERS`, `MODULES`, `SIMENGINE`, etc., as shown in:\n```\nhttps://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2DPG/blob/master/MC/run/PWGLF/runLFInjector.sh\n```",
            "To configure ALICE Run3 simulation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` script to define your simulation workflow. This script is part of the O2DPG repository, which provides a coherent and consistent environment for MC jobs.\n\n2. For event generation, you can use the `o2_hybrid_gen.py` script to generate a configuration file for your event generators. This script requires O2 to be loaded in your environment to get the necessary parameters.\n\n3. Configure the simulation by setting parameters. These parameters can be influenced via configuration files or from the command line using the `--configFile` or `--configKeyValues` options. A list of important parameters and their default values can be found in the `o2sim_configuration.ini` file.\n\n4. Use the `anchorMC.sh` steering script for adding any additional pre- or post-processing steps. This script can be called inside another shell script, and it allows you to run additional commands before or after the simulation.\n\n5. Ensure you have the required software environment, which includes the O2Sim package available via CVMFS or built from source.\n\nFor detailed configuration options and parameters, refer to the [ConfigurableParam.md](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/Common/SimConfig/doc/ConfigurableParam.md) documentation.",

            "To access `TrackReferences`, you can use the `MCTrackNavigator` class provided by AliceO2. Specifically, you can fetch the mother and primary tracks of a given track using the following methods:\n\n```cpp\nauto mother = o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator::getMother(t, tracks);\nauto primary = o2::mcutil::MCTrackNavigator::getFirstPrimary(t, tracks);\n```\n\nHere, `t` is the track for which you want to find the mother and primary tracks, and `tracks` is a vector containing all the Monte Carlo tracks.\n\nFor more details and additional methods available in `MCTrackNavigator`, you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/blob/dev/DataFormats/simulation/include/SimulationDataFormat/MCUtils.h)."
