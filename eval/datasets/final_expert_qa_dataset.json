    "question": "How do you run a simple simulation at generation level?",
    "correct_answer": "The basic way is to use the o2-sim executable provided natively by the O2sim environment.\nThe executable allows to enable particle transport through a simulated version of the ALICE subdetectors via Geant4 (default), Geant3 or FLUKA. \nThe easiest command one could execute is:\n```\no2-sim -n 10 -g pythia8pp\n```\nwhich will run 10 events with the default configuration of Pythia8 in pp collisions transported using Geant4."

    "question": "What are the differences between using o2-sim and running a full simulation workflow?",
    "correct_answer": "o2-sim is the main executable to run simulations, but it's a single step that will ultimately lead to a kinematic file and Hits files if the particles are transported to the various subdetectors. A simulation workflow instead contains multiple steps that mimic entirely the data workflow of the ALICE experiment."

    "question": "How do you create and use event pools?",
    "correct_answer": "The creation of event pools is done via the `--make-evtpool` flag of the workflow creator. This generates a JSON workflow that skips the AOD creation and, instead, moves to a *poolmerge* step that merges the output from the various timeframes generated into a single `evtpool.root` file.\nAn easy example is:\n```bash\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -gen pythia8pp -eCM 13000 -tf 8 -ns 100 --make-evtpool -interactionRate 500000 -seed 123\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt pool\n```\nThe generated file can later be used via the `evtpool` generator that allows multiple events reading customisations (round-robin, randomisation etc.) and is compatible with either local paths or alien ones, making it extremely versatile. A configuration example using the hybrid generator is:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\": \"evtpool\",\n  \"config\": {\n    \"eventPoolPath\": \"alien:///alice/sim/2025/EP25f1/2\",\n    \"skipNonTrackable\": true,\n    \"roundRobin\": false,\n    \"randomize\": true,\n    \"rngseed\": 0,\n    \"randomphi\": false\n  }\n}\n```"

    "question": "Can you provide CCDB objects for simulations instead of downloading them each time? If so, how?",
    "correct_answer": "Yes this is achievable thanks to local CCDB snapshots. The O2DPG workflow fetches automatically all the CCDB objects and caches them into the current execution path in a *ccdb* folder. Instead of downloading them each time, experts can provide local folders using:\n```bash\nexport ALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE=/<your>/<path>\n```\nor while executing the workflow runner with:\n```bash\nALICEO2_CCDB_LOCALCACHE=${YOURPATH} o2_dpg_workflow_runner.py â€¦\n```\nMoreover a script is available to download CCDB objects manually\n```bash\n${O2_ROOT}/bin/o2-ccdb-downloadccdbfile --host http://alice-ccdb.cern.ch -p TPC/Calib/CorrectionMapRef --timestamp <timestamp> --created-not-after 3385078236000 \n-d ${YOURPATH}\n```"

    "correct_answer": "o2-sim can be used as on-the-fly generator for analysis purposes injecting events directly into a DPL topology without intermediate storage. This can be used in hyperloop trains and it is useful for fast-simulation studies within analysis framework. An example: \n```bash\n# Launch simulation\no2-sim -j 1 -g pythia8pp -n 10 --noDiscOutput --forwardKine --noGeant &> sim.log &\n# Launch a DPL process\no2-sim-mctracks-proxy -b --nevents 10 --o2sim-pid ${SIMPROC} --aggregate-timeframe 1 &\n```\nOn Hyperloop this is done by generating a dummy dataset containing the ini file that will be picked up for the simulation."

It steers event generation, constructs the detector geometry and material and performs particle-transport simulation via a Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) abstraction so users can choose Geant4, Geant3 or FLUKA as backend. `o2-sim` produces hit files for each sensitive detector (e.g. `o2sim_HitsITS.root`) and a kinematics file (by default `o2sim_Kine.root`) containing primary and secondary particle information.

    "answer": "Use the O2DPG-provided workflows which integrate the AliceO2 executables into end-to-end MC pipelines. Two supported ways are:\n\n1) Build and run a workflow explicitly with the two O2DPG Python scripts:\n\n- Create the workflow description (workflow.json) with `o2dpg_sim_workflow.py` and then execute it with `o2dpg_workflow_runner.py`.\n\nExample:\n`\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_sim_workflow.py -eCM 14000  -col pp -gen pythia8 -tf 1 -ns 2000 --interactionRate 500000 -run 302000\n\n${O2DPG_ROOT}/MC/bin/o2dpg_workflow_runner.py -f workflow.json -tt aod\n`\nThis configures a complete simulation for 1 timeframe of pp collisions and runs up to the `aod` stage.\n\n2) (Typical user) Use the provided anchor script `anchorMC.sh`, which manages setup and execution for MC that matches real data-taking conditions. You set a few obligatory environment variables (data-taking period, reconstruction pass, plus generator options) and call the script.

The `o2-sim` executable has command line options to set top-level choices such as the event generator, the simulator backend, the output filename, etc. (see `o2-sim --help`). ConfigurableParams are two-level key-value strings `MainKey.SubKey=Value` passed via the `--configKeyValues` option; the main key addresses a broader category and the sub-key a specific modifiable variable. Example configurable parameter: `G4Params.configMacroFile` to set a Geant4 input file. Full example: `o2-sim -e TGeant4 --configKeyValues=\"G4Params.configMacroFile=myG4config.in\"`. Under the hood ConfigurableParams are C++ classes registered in a service whose registry knows all available configurable params and can spot wrong keys/sub-keys."
